DIY Bridal Shower Desserts
Give your bride the BEST Bridal Shower Ever! Instead of spending tons of cash on store bought Bridal Shower desserts that are sub-par, do it yourself! Homemade treats not only show her you put in effort, but they taste magnificent! Give her a day she’ll never forget with these desserts that are sure to impress and of course, be fit for a Bride!
These not only look beautiful, but they taste so much better homemade! Follow a few simple steps and impress all your friends! First, bake a cake using your favorite cake mix or recipe and allow it to cool completely. Next, break down the cake into crumbs- this can be done with your hands or a food processor. Add frosting to the crumbled cake, and form into balls. Once the balls are formed, place into the freezer for ten minutes until they harden. Once this step is complete, place the ball on a stick and dip into melted chocolate followed by sprinkles, nuts or any topping of your choice! Voila! You just became a pro pastry chef! Everyone will be raving about them and no one needs to know how easy it was! Your secret’s safe with us!

How to Write a Blog Post
So you’re interested in writing a blog post? Well, the process of writing a post can be daunting. Sometimes writing flows naturally, and sometimes you need a mental break to get things going. Have no fear, because I’m here to tell you the foolproof way to write a riveting blog post.

Brainstorming is the first step to writing anything. Before you can write a blog post, you must think of what to write! Write out every topic that comes to mind – literally every topic. Once you’ve got a list written out, start to think about your audience and the reaction you would like to receive. Who are you trying to appeal to? What message are you trying to send? Narrow down your list of topics until you find the perfect one. If you’re feeling uninspired, you can always consult the Internet for ideas.
Now that you have a topic, the next step in the writing process is to start writing. Honestly, this can be the hardest step. You want your audience to be captivated quickly, so come up with an interesting title and an opening line they can’t resist. Then, once you’ve exhausted your brain trying to find the right opener, take a little break to refresh yourself, then continue writing. I usually repeat this process 4 times while writing (it takes a while for me to come up with such high quality blogs). Eventually, you will finish the blog post after you feel guilty for putting it off for so long.
Once you have finished writing your blog post and are feeling confident that it’s perfect in every way- start revising. You will realize that you aren’t as flawless as you once thought. There’s no shame in revising. In fact, it’s the most important step in the process. You can rarely achieve perfection at the first take, so go back and edit, edit, edit! The quality of your post will increase tenfold.
After the revision process, you’re almost ready to publish, but there’s the inevitable step of self-doubt. You may start to rethink your life decisions and wonder what led you to even write this post. You start to imagine scenarios in your head where you are the headline in national news, because you have written the worst blog ever. You’re humiliated both locally and worldwide, and can never leave your house due to harassment and embarrassment. But then you realize you’re being ridiculous and finish the final step in the process, which is…
Congrats! You have accomplished all of the steps following up to this one. You have overcome every obstacle there is to writing a blog post and are finally ready to publish. Now click the publish button and be proud of what you have written!

5 Good Ways to De-stress
Odds are, at any given moment, you are experiencing some type of stress. You could be stressed out about school, work, social life, etc. If you feel like your head is going to explode, then continue reading to learn 5 great ways to de-stress.
Take Back Your Health Conference
Tea can help end your day right. Drinking a warm cup of tea every night can help calm your nerves before falling asleep. Chamomile and lavender tea are known for their pleasant aromas, and are the perfect anecdote for a long, stressful day. Snuggle up with a nice cup and book before bed to have a good night’s rest, and wake up feeling rejuvenated.
Taking a bath is a great way to relax, although it’s time consuming. Taking a bath at least once a week allows for some much needed pampering time. In order to enhance your relaxation in the bathtub, throw in some Epsom salts, which have many health benefits, including relaxation of the body. You’ll feel like a brand new person afterwards!
Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural stress fighters within your own body. Next time you feel the need to blow off some steam, head to the gym and get a quick workout in. If you can’t make it to the gym, then jog around your neighborhood. This way you can feel great and look great too.
Sometimes life gets very cluttered, which can lead to an overload of stress. If life gets too hectic, take some time to organize. Create a game plan. Write out everything you have to do and when you should do it by. Clean up around you. Take a shower. All of these things can help clear your mind and lead to less stress.
Breathing deeply is a useful tactic that can relieve stress immediately. This is easy, because it’s simply breathing. You can breathe anywhere! If you’re in public and start to feel overwhelmed, just take a minute to breathe deeply at least 3 times. Your nerves will calm, and you’re then ready to tackle anything that comes your way.

The point person running the daily aspects of a campaign can’t be a one man band, but rather needs to identify key advocates to help give and share the campaign.
Key advocates are like the spokes stemming from the hub of a wheel – they are the people who spread the word about a campaign through social media and communicating with their own networks.
The campaign manager is responsible for giving key advocates the tools and timelines necessary in order to easily and effectively share the campaign.
