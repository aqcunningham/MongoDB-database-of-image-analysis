	                    iPad 5 Launching on October 15: Here’s What it Looks Like					
With Apple launching its new iPhones last week, the focus has already switched to what other new products the Cupertino-based firm will be rolling out next. And now it looks like we might soon see legions of fanbois camping outside Apple stores once again in the very near future, as leaks of a new iPad have just surfaced on the interwebs.
Chinese parts supplier 
 posted an almost 6-minute-long video comparing the device, dubbed as the iPad 5, to the iPad 4 and the iPad mini.
The video shows a new iPad that’s looking thinner and smaller without the usual tapered edges, and sporting a darker silver color.
The video didn’t really go into what makes the new iPad different other than the size, a new-ish look, and an extra mic at the back.  No features were discussed and no mention of whether or not Touch ID is present on the device.
What we do know however, is that the iPad 5 (if it really is an iPad 5) measures 239.20mm in height, 169.50mm in width, a depth of 7.2mm, and weighs 92 grams.  This makes the iPad 5 smaller, thinner, and lighter compared to the iPad 4’s 241.2mm x 185.70mm x 9.4mm, and 146 grams dimensions.
Aside from the measurements, the video showed 
 that the new iPad has.  It shows how the iPad 5 is more similar to the iPad mini.  It features two buttons for volume control, unlike the older version which has one toggle button to control the volume.  The speakers are located at the bottom center of the device, there’s an extra mic hole at the top, the logo at the back has a mirror effect like the iPad mini, and finally, the edges are rounder, instead of tapering off which will make it more comfortable to hold when used for longer periods.
The video also showed a new iPad case that fits perfectly with the iPad 5, that doesn’t obstruct the ports, buttons, speakers and mic.
Question now is, when will the iPad 5 be announced and when will it be available for purchase?  Reports 
 that the device will be launched on October 15, 2013, and will probably go on sale a week after.
