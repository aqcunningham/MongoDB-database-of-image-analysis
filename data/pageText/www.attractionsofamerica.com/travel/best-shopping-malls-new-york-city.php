Top 7 Best Shopping Malls in and around New York City
Top 7 Best Shopping Malls in and around New York City
        The Big Apple is all about grandeur and trendsetting, it comes as no surprise that you will find some of the best shopping malls here in the world.  Maybe you won’t find the biggest, that title belongs to the Mall of America, and maybe you won’t find the most expensive malls in the world, but what you will find are some of the most coveted and popular malls here.  All you favorite brands, fashion trends, and celebrity hangouts are here.  These are our top seven malls in and around 
 that you cannot miss. 
1: Westfield World Trade Center
Rate this attraction:
This mall is definitely one of the most expensive and most controversial out of all our malls on the list.  The Westfield WTC is built right in the Occulus Transportation Hub, and it certainly stands out with its architecture.  Even if you can’t afford most of the stuff inside the 100-plus stores, it is still a great experience to look around and browse the high fashion on display.
 185 Greenwich St, New York, NY 10007
2: Shops at Columbus Circle
Rate this attraction:
This is a more traditional shopping mall, but with plenty of high end shopping to purchase.  You’ll get a wide range of brands here, from Chanel, Hugo Boss, Dillards, to Swarovski.  If you follow the stairs to the basement, you’ll be able to pick up some fresh organic snacks at the Whole Foods Market below.
 10 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10023
Rate this attraction:
This mall is distinctly New York, located right off the subway line and no traditional parking lot available.  It’s a great little mall, you can find a humble selection of stores to pick up some great deals—Victoria’s Secret, Barnes and Noble, Hallmark, with a JC Penney taking up the bulk of the lot.  You can take a line from this mall directly to New Jersey, so it’s a nice segue.
 100 West 33rd Street, New York, NY 10001
4: Grand Central Terminal
Rate this attraction:
Although, the attraction to Grand Central is the station itself, there are also lots of nice shops that you can pick up some new clothes and accessories.  The food court here is a cut above what you would normally find at a shopping mall, too.  Delicious Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and of course the classic New York hot dog.
 89 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10016
5: Queens Center Mall
Rate this attraction:
This mall is a massive 440,000 square foot plaza with everything you could possibly need.  All the categories are covered here: Best Buy, Target, Macy’s, and a Designer Shoe Warehouse.  Pick up some household supplies while shopping for a new look, it’s all here under one roof.
 90-15 Queens Blvd, Elmhurst, NY 11373
6: Staten Island Mall
Rate this attraction:
You have a very large variety of places to shop at Staten Island Mall.  You probably won’t be able to visit each one for more than a minute or two if you plan on covering the whole mall in one day.  Plus, it has a nice little market that sells fresh produce, so you can supplement your meal at the food court, if you wish.
 2655 Richmond Ave, Staten Island, NY 10314
7: Newport Centre Mall
Rate this attraction:
We would say that Newport Centre Mall is the most affordable mall on the list, thanks to the lower taxes in the state of New Jersey.  Even the theater is cheaper here.  You could travel directly to this mall from the Manhattan Mall, if shopping is your priority.  
 30 Mall Dr W, Jersey City, NJ 07310
