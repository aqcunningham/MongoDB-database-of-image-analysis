					New York 2016 - Helicopter tour
The Grand Tour Helicopter Flight Plan:
The Grand tour is nothing short of its name as it does both The Liberty and The Central Park tour.  The Grand Tour offers sights of the Verrazano Bridge and the famous Coney Island in Brooklyn, Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx and a bird’s eye view of Yankee Stadium. This tour will let you experience New York history, New York Baseball and the excitement of a lifetime in the city that never sleeps!
The Liberty Tour lets you take in all the sights of lower Manhattan. Departing from Pier 6 you’ll see the South Street Seaport, the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridge and Wall Street financial center. As we fly along the Hudson River you’ll take in the site of the famous Statue of Liberty, Ellis and Governors Island, the Empire State building and the Intrepid sea, air and space museum. But before the tour is over you’ll get to see part of Central park.
The Central park tour will show you all the sites that make New York famous. You’ll see all the sites of the Liberty tour and more such as the outskirts of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and New Jersey. We will continue up the Hudson River and you’ll see the United Nations, all of Central Park and the George Washington Bridge. The fun does not stop there; next you will make a grand sweep of the George Washington Bridge.
