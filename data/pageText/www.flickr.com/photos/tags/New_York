Time Square has an energy all it's own.   I think this is one of the best illustrations of the phrase, “New York, the city that never sleeps.”

New York City - Manhattan Skyline Twilight
Manhattan Skyline - One World Trade Center - New York City.
The distinctive skyline of Manhattan is composed of some of the word's tallest skyscrapers, 9 of which have held the title of "world's tallest" since the 1800's. These days, the yet unfiinished 104-story One World Trade Center stands out above the rest, shining brightly in white lights on the right.

New York City : Metropolitan Museum of Art
New York City : Metropolitan Museum of Art
"The Metropolitan Museum of Art, known colloquially as The Met, is an art museum located on the eastern edge of Central Park, along what is known as Museum Mile in New York City, USA. Its permanent collection contains more than two million works of art, divided into nineteen curatorial departments. The main building, often referred to simply as "the Met", is one of the world's largest art galleries; there is also a much smaller second location in Upper Manhattan, at "The Cloisters", which features medieval art."
These are from our family trip to New York City the summer of 2010.  My kids were totally fascinated by the Egyptian exhibit at the museum.  I think they could have spent a week there.  We rented the recorded tour guide thingies and they ran off on their own.  Gosh it was next to impossible to find everyone and get us back together.  This is certainly a must do on any trip to New York City.

New York City Skyline
I recently edited this to print on a large canvas, for a 60th Birthday Gift. 
It was always going to hang in a purple themed room, so it fits the bill nicely.

New York depuis Brooklyn au coucher du soleil. Si j'ai eu la chance d'aller plusieurs fois à San Francisco, la semaine que j'ai passée à New York n'était clairement pas suffisante en comparaison. Vivement que je puisse y retourner afin d'explorer les magnifiques points de vue que cette ville offre. :-)

Spent the last two weeks in NYC as my girlfriend was working over there - wasn't going to miss up on that! I didn't take a tripod with me, but seeing this view 5 minute walk from our hotel made me realise I'd been an idiot so off I went to Best Buy, and this is the result!
