“Regardless of how you feel inside, always try to look like a winner. Even if you are behind, a sustained look of control and confidence can give you a mental edge that results in victory.” - Arthur Ashe 
It seems winning comes easier to some, are winners born or made?  I believe that winners have an attitude that helps them achieve their goals and allows them to be confident throughout the journey.

The Empire and the Chrysler
This shot was taken from the top of Arthur Ashe stadium in Flushing, NY.I was there last weekend to watch the US open Finals. Was lucky to be seated at the west side of the stadium from where I could see the Sun set over the NYC skyline. Here is a shot of the silhouette of the Empire state building and the Chrysler building.
