Reflection / Kolonihavehus by Tom Fruin and CoreAct @ DUMBO Arts Festival, Brooklyn Bridge Park, NYC
ARTIST: Tom Fruin and CoreAct
DESCRIPTION: Reflection/Kolonihavehus is a poetic performance installation that can be experienced on several levels; as an intimate performance and/or a sculptural intervention in an urban space, 24 hours a day.
Reflection is a poetic interpretation concerning our daily choices or lack of choices and their consequences to our common future. The colorful glass house is inhabited by two performers, who portray everyday dilemmas and lifestyle paradoxes in a subtle manner. They have lost the ability to meaningfully discriminate, and are trapped in a long chain of procrastination, mirroring our current social patterns. As an audience you can wonder in and out of the performance as you like. You get to make a choice.
The colorful glass house sculpture is created by internationally renowned sculptor Tom Fruin. It will be on view throughout Festival hours.
