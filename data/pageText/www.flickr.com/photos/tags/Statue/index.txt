Statue - Venezia, Italia
I’m doing some revisiting on some old travel photos. These photos have been in my Flickr for about a year now, and I decided to give them a second chance. I can explain that.
Recently I’ve read on a photographer’s website that people should publish (post/upload) their best works only. The hint to achieve that was to first pick the Top 50 among them. Once this is done, then the pick the Top 40 and keep on like this until finally reaching Top 10. Then you are good to upload them.
Analyzing my photos from last year visit to Italy, I realized I had too many photos there (192 photos). So, why not choose my Top 10? Besides that, after 1 year, I’ve learned something about Lightroom, so, why not re-do some post-processing also? At first, I thought “It will be piece of cake. I can do that in a couple hours”. Well, until things started to go all wrong…
What is the problem? Choosing the photos is not an easy task. Not that the pictures are too good, but because they have lots of (good) memories in them. It’s difficult to have the criteria solely based on composition, colors, exposure and other technical stuff. I’ve tried hard to reach at least my Top 50, but couldn’t go farther than Top 60 (it was like 57 but decided to round up so it would sound better).
If someone feel like giving me some hand and say something like “Fabio, take this one from the list, it’s is not so good” I will take any suggestions.

The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the United States. The copper statue, designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, a French sculptor, was built by Gustave Eiffel and dedicated on October 28, 1886. It was a gift to the United States from the people of France. The statue is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States, and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad. (Source:

A Venice of the North, they call Bruge in Belgium, and not without reason. They have many canals and old houses. The Medieval center of the city is a truly wonderful place. This photo is from one the bridges crossing one of the canals.

As the day was really, really overcast this picture lacked any spark so it got pushed into photoshop for some tweaking.

A mini-version of the Statue of Liberty.
A replica on the Île aux Cygnes, River Seine in Paris, France.                             
A notable feature is a quarter-scale replica of Liberty Enlightening the World, commonly known as the Statue of Liberty, 22 metres tall and facing west in the direction of its larger sibling in New York City. Inaugurated by President Marie François Sadi Carnot on 4 July 1889,[3] nearly three years after its US counterpart, it was donated to the city by the American expatriate community in Paris to mark the centennial of the French Revolution.
The statue originally faced east, toward the Eiffel Tower, but it was turned west in 1937 for the world's fair hosted in Paris that year. At its base is a commemorative plaque, and the tablet in its left hand bears the inscription IV Juillet 1776 = XIV Juillet 1789, recognizing the American Independence Day and the French Bastille Day.
