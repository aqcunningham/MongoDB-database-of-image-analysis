Foggy day in New York 
Nice having a slight zoom at times with the landscapes. Here the 17/55 lens came in handy to get a little tighter comp on the falls from this vantage point that I like. The comp here is of course about the falls, but wondering if a little more sky might have improved this capture some?

Lower Manhattan just after dusk as seen from old Pier 1 at Brooklyn Bridge Park.  Hard not to be happy to see the new World Trade Center takes its place in the skyline.

My favorite local place to hike, the visibility that day was about 150 feet which made it very dreamlike.

 To see these amazing architectural masterpieces being built is really pretty awesome. I for one can't wait till they get completed. I believe they are planning shopping center's and restaurants in one of the buildings.
Have a great week everyone~!
