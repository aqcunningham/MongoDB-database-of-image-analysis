Arriving to Meiji temple on a rainy day, probably for the Shichi-Go-San ceremony.

Looking through the archives for a nice landscape shot I tripped over this one. I have edited the jpeg in LR 5 to give it this look.

First shot with the WCL-X100 28mm add-on for the X100. No quality change whatsoever and I feel so much more comfortable with the few extra millimeters. Can´t wait to hit the streets with it...
I don't know what's so great about it. All it ever does is rain outdoors. But it does bring with it some magnificently mean looking skies.

This could´ve been a staged selfie, but...it´s actually not.
I was out driving through the countryside on the lookout for a "pretty picture", (that´s what I call my LE work). In the distance I saw this figure walking along the empty road and when I got closer I saw his umbrella. I don´t know why, but umbrellas makes great pictures in my own mind.
I drove into the side of the road, took my camera and yelled out an order, "keep walking!!"
I lost all shyness/respect, all I saw and thought of was the image.
Afterwards I apologized and laughed while I was trying to explain my nutty behavior. He took it well and it was kinda worth it. My way of shooting is normally quiet and discrete with lots of respect for my subjects. But, not in this case :)
One morning I decided to get up early and shoot the sunrise. Well this one is not really a sunrise shot as the sun was behind me.

Looking at some shots out of my "old" Fuji X100S.
It was and is a great camera. I have only just got myself the X100T and must say that this is an even better camera in terms of usability.
The image qualitiy is just the same awesome 16MP sensor. This is more than enough for all of us showing shots on the web and even for prints up to 1,20m x 0,9m. 
I would even go so far as to say that a great 12MP sensor with even less noise and greater dynamic range would be better.
