Thank you for visiting my Etsy shop. All of the images you see in my shop were taken by me and are professionally printed in a lab. 
Below you can find answers to the most common questions related to shipping, payment, returns, custom orders and general shop policies.
All of my prints are custom made just for you, and carefully created and signed after payment has been received. Please allow up to 2 weeks for your order to be printed, and a few extra days for shipping. Though it is usually much quicker! There are times when I am traveling, taking new photographs, and cannot process orders immediately. If you have a specific deadline, please let me know and I will work to accommodate your wishes. Please also keep in mind when ordering that every computer monitor displays colors slightly differently, so what you see on your screen could conceivably vary a little from the prints you receive.
If you have any additional inquiries or need assistance, please don't hesitate to send me a note. I'm happy to help: 
I hope you find something you love.
Accepted payment methods
Accepts Etsy Gift Cards and Etsy Credits
Returns and exchanges
I want you to be satisfied and happy with your purchase. If you are for some reason not 100% satisfied and wish to return your order, please notify me within 1 week of receiving your item(s). The product should be sent back within 5 days after notification, and returned, appropriately packaged, in its original condition. Shipping charges are non-refundable and shipment return costs are at your expense. Full item cost (minus shipping) will be refunded upon receipt of the returned item.
I accept PayPal, credit or debit card payments, as well as Etsy gift cards. Payment is required within 24 hours of an item's purchase or it will be re-listed as available. Orders will not be processed until confirmation of payment has been received.
I will ship to the address you provide to Etsy. If applicable I am happy to ship directly to your gift recipient! If you would like me to include a special note or gift message, please indicate that during checkout and I will make sure to add it to the package.
Your package will probably include recycled packaging materials. I hope you appreciate my attempt to reduce my environmental impact, and hope you will reuse them again too.
Within the United States all orders are shipped via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation or via UPS in the case of larger orders.
— International Orders —
I'm happy to ship orders internationally. Most make it to their destinations quickly, but occasionally packages get stuck in customs and take a little longer. For this reason I kindly ask you to allow up to 4-6 weeks (especially around the holidays) on international orders.
International orders may incur additional fees, taxes, tariffs, duties, or customs charges. Since I cannot predict or calculate these charges, the buyer is responsible for their payment, should they occur. I will not accept returns due to customs fees.
••• Please note that packages can sometimes take a bit longer to arrive under the following conditions: increased volume of mail around the holidays, delays at customs, and inclement weather. It can also take longer for packages to arrive in certain countries such as Australia and countries in Africa, Asia and South America.
— Expedited Shipping —
Upon request I can ship your item expedited (next-day in the US, 6-8 days internationally) at an additional cost of $15-20 depending on the order. Please contact me if you're interested in this option.
— How Prints Are shipped —
Prints up to 16" x 24" are enclosed inside a cellophane sleeve to protect against moisture and are shipped flat in a rigid cardboard photo mailer. Larger prints are shipped in a rigid tube, interlaced with archival glassine paper. Upon shipping, I will send you a confirmation email to let you know your order is on its way. 
— Lost or Damaged Items —
A package will be considered lost if you have not received it within 3 weeks after shipment for domestic packages, or 6 weeks after shipment for international packages. I will replace lost packages at no charge after that amount of time has passed. If you are concerned that the shipment of your order is taking too long to reach you, please don't hesitate to contact me first. 
If your order arrives damaged in any way, please let me know and I will send you a replacement. If I've somehow messed up your order just send me a message and I'll get the correct goods to you asap, along with a prepaid return envelope for the incorrect items.
                                    We make it easy to find your thing.
