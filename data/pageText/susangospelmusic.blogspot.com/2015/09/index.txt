爵士歌曲：Autumn in New York 紐約的秋天（歌詞翻譯）
Ella Fitzgerald與Louis Amstrong
Autumn in New York 紐約的秋天 
Why does it seem so inviting
It spells the thrill of first-nighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
They're making me feel, I'm home
It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands
May sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Oh, autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down
Yes, jaded roues and gay divorces
Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine
This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain
Yes, lovers that bless the dark
Oh, on the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
So Nice（Summer Samba）現場演出&歌詞翻譯
這首歌 So nice，我最喜歡的一句歌詞就是：
「Someone to understand each little dream in me, 
Someone to take my hand, to be a team with me. 
So Nice / Summer Samba（夏日森巴）翻譯：Susan
Someone to hold me tight,  that would be very nice.
Someone to love me right,  that would be very nice.
Someone to understand each little dream in me.
Someone to take my hand, to be a team with me.
So nice, life would be so nice, 
Someone who would take my hand And samba through life with me
Someone to cling to me,
Stay with me right or wrong.
Someone to sing to me some little samba song. 
Someone to take my heart and give his heart to me.
Someone who's ready toGive love a start with me.
Oh yes, that would be so nice.
I could see you and me, that would be nice
ave you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Faint as a willow the wisp
Sad as a gypsty serenading the moon
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there
