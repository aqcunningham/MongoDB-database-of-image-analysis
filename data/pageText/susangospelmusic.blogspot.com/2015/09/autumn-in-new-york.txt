爵士歌曲：Autumn in New York 紐約的秋天（歌詞翻譯）
Ella Fitzgerald與Louis Amstrong
Autumn in New York 紐約的秋天 
Why does it seem so inviting
It spells the thrill of first-nighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
They're making me feel, I'm home
It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands
May sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Oh, autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down
Yes, jaded roues and gay divorces
Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine
This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain
Yes, lovers that bless the dark
Oh, on the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
