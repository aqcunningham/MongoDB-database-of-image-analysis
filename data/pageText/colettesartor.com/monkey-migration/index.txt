Even Monkeys Migrate in the fall.
Let’s get this out of the way: I like pretty things.
Monkey Mind and butterfly
I like pretty clothes and I like pretty bags and I like pretty writing (though by “pretty” I mean writing that is elegant and clean and packs a punch). I even like my food to look pretty.
And, apparently, I like my emails to look pretty as well.
Which is why I’ve finally migrated my email subscription service from JetPack to MailChimp.
Get it, “migrated,” so I could work in my post title. Yeah, I know. Lame. But I needed an excuse for a monkey picture.
For any of you who already subscribe to my blog via email, this won’t affect you at all. This is where you can tune out.
For any of you who are WordPress.com subscribers (i.e., those of you who subscribed by following my blog through your own WordPress accounts), you’re the ones who will be affected by this changeover. JetPack doesn’t allow me to transfer you all over to MailChimp. So as soon as I deactivate my JetPack subscription service,  you’ll no longer receive emails from me when I published a new post.
So, if any of you WordPress.com subscribers are interested in receiving my new and improved update emails, 
please click here to subscribe via my new, pretty MailChimp subscription form
Or you can subscribe using the form at the end of this post, which isn’t nearly as pretty.
Or, if you’d prefer to just catch up by checking in on WordPress, that’s cool too.
Either way, please keep reading. I promise, there’s more to come!
