Personal finance website WalletHub recently led an analysis to measure the level of happiness in each American state. Taking a look at state residents' emotional and physical wellbeing, relationship towards work and feelings towards the community, the site compared the 50 areas using 28 relevant metrics (think share of adult depression, sports-participation rate, life expectancy, job security, volunteer rate and ideal weather, for example).
The results were fairly interesting. Colorado topped the list of highest adequate-sleep rate (Hawaii came in last) and highest sports participation rate (Mississippi came in last). New York has the lowest suicide rate (Wyoming has the highest), Utah citizens work the fewest hours, volunteer at the highest rate across the country and get divorced the least (Nevada has the highest divorce rate) while North Dakota boasts the lowest long-term unemployment rate. Vermont is reputed the safest state in the country and Mississippi the least safe.
