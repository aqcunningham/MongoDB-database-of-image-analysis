7 Best Bougie & Boozy Brunches in NYC
anything that is seen as upscale or refers to the affluent class in the United States.
Letâ€™s be real, New Yorkers love two things, brunch and pretending to be unfazed by the bougiest possible situations. If you are visiting NYC, you must attend a good weekend brunch. Here are my picks for the best brunch to channel your inner Gossip Girl.
This gorgeous luxury restaurant is hidden behind an old pawnshop. When you first see the building, it appears to be an abandoned furniture store turned run down cash for gold storefront. Like all good things in NYC, you have to know what youâ€™re looking for to see it. You enter through a hidden door at the back of the pawnshop. Once inside, youâ€™re immediately part of a world that feels like a secret club. Everything is upscale and drips high-end ambiance and dirty sexy money. Every time I eat here, I wear my best heels and use it as an excuse to get a blowout â€“ itâ€™s that kind of place. Luckily, the food while overpriced is absolutely delicious. If youâ€™re going for brunch try the red velvet waffles with cream cheese icing ($12). If youâ€™re feeling like a cocktail, try the Sapphire Seventy-Five. Itâ€™s a mixture of blueberry brown sugar Bombay Sapphire with prosecco and sour mix. No matter what you order, you wonâ€™t be disappointed.
Functional Fashion-Forward Footwear for the Traveling Femme
This high-end eatery is a place to see and be seen. They are just as well known for their page-6 clientele as they are for their delicious shareable tapas menu items. The French onion soup dumplings are an absolute must. Also, try the potato and goat cheese pierogies. The only critique is that they are supposed to be shared and my greedy inner self always wants more. I quickly forget once the next course is served. Donâ€™t forget to make a reservation. Prices range from $8-$26 for each tapas item.
Casa La Femme is an elegant Egyptian restaurant tucked into a corner of the West Village. The set menu is the perfect way to try a sampling of Egyptian dishes. Try the traditional Egyptian style mousaka with peppers, tomatoes, Egyptian cheese and eggplant. After you eat order a flavored hookah and enjoy the belly dancers performance with a cocktail. The Quitini is one of Casa La Femmeâ€™s signature cocktails. It is Qui platinum extra anejo tequila, cointreau, with a splash of fresh l lime juice and pink grapefruit. The cocktail is shaken and served in a sugar and sumac crusted martini glass topped with French Sparkling wine. Prices range from $8-$26.
Bar Bacon is not as bougie as the other restaurants on this list, but it has a trendy cute vibe and the food is so good it cannot be missed. It has a bit of a downtown feel to it with their bacon and hipster themed dÃ©cor but one bite of their delicious home-style comfort food and you wonâ€™t care if you were seated in a cardboard box on Avenue C. Order one of their flights beer, bacon or whiskey. Donâ€™t miss out on the flight of five different flavors of bacon itâ€™s the best part.
What It's Like to be a Black & Transgender Traveler
Elmo is an uber trendy restaurant specializing in gay chic and swankier versions of American comfort food. The ambiance is less pretentious than some of the other restaurants on this list, but the crowd is always filled with upscale eye candy. The waiters are aspiring actors and models. Try the Chicken Fried Chicken and the Baked Four Cheese Mac.
The Dream Downtown has a rooftop lounge called PHD it is just as well known for its amazing pool parties and nightclub as it is for its incredible brunch. Eating brunch at The Dream is kinda of like eating breakfast at the trendiest nightclub you know.
This futuristic hotel would make the Jetsonâ€™s jealous. In the summer, brunch is served on the outdoor patio with scenic west village views. The view and the gay nightclub turned breakfast party are enough entertainment for any party goer. For a super affordable $35 you can enjoy the breakfast buffet and unlimited cocktails for 2 hours.

Casa La Femme for me I think, although Iâ€™d love a week where I could try out a different one each night (and fit in a show or two as well!)

Love this. I always like to do brunch when I am traveling. Such a fun meal. Thanks for the suggestions.

Brunch is Key! Plus a great way to save on travel expenses. A large mid-day meal can count as two!

Thanks for all the tips! The Dream Downtown looks especially nice, though of course itâ€™s hard to tell what the food is like. Iâ€™ll need to pin this post to my New York City board!

The Dream is a great place, though, itâ€™s not for the faint of heart. Thanks for reading ðŸ™‚ & for the pin!

What fun. I still remember the Sex in the City gals and their constant brunches. Youâ€™ve put theirs to shame â€“ location, location, location.

I am from NY and havenâ€™t tried any of these places haha. The red velvet waffles sound amazing. It is very true, NY has a lot of hidden things, you have to know what your looking for sometimes.

They are sooo good. Dangerously good. Some of my favorite places in NY were places I accidently stumbled on OR friends told me about. Itâ€™s all about being in the know. Thanks for reading ðŸ™‚

Yep, red velvet waffles are always a must.
Iâ€™m so loving brunches these days. I havenâ€™t trotted around NYC in quite some time. Itâ€™s the perfect reason to come, well when it warms.
