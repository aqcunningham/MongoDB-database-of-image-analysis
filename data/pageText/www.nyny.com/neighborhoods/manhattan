The Ritz-Carlton New York, Battery Park
Manhattan is the most populous borough from 9 to 5 and the crazy land of big buildings, paper-thin models, bulls, bears and sky-high rent. Bars of every genre, awesome parks, countless restaurants and every business you could ever imagine make this walk-everywhere borough seem like a great, big adult Disneyland. You'll see just about everything when wandering these streets, from people sleeping on sidewalks to movie stars walking their dogs to strange art installations to people with no clothes—truly, this place is unlike any other.

Lowest Rates Guaranteed
Our Low Price Hotel Guarantee
We are confident that our hotel prices are guaranteed to be the lowest rate you can find. If you find a lower rate for your hotel on another site, we’ll refund the difference to you. Book with us and enjoy total peace of mind!
If you find a lower rate at any time up until hotel's cancellation window, we'll match the price. The lower price you find needs to be for the same dates, length of stay and room type.
Found a better price?
The lower price you found must be available on another website directed to consumers in the same locale, and must be for the same hotel, dates and room type. 
If you used a coupon/discount voucher when you made your original booking, you can still claim under the guarantee. We will use the total discounted price you paid and compare this to the lower price you found in order to calculate your refund.
If you have made a booking which cannot be cancelled — whether it is non-refundable or if you are already within the cancellation window for the hotel — then you can't claim under the guarantee. Bookings that were part of a specific promotion (e.g. 3 nights for the price of 2) are also excluded from claiming under the guarantee.
Once we have confirmed that you are due a refund under the guarantee we will issue the refund to the card you paid with at the time of booking. We will process your refund immediately but it may take your bank up to 30 days to process it and for it to show on your statement.
