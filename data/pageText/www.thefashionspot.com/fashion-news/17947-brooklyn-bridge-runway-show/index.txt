BROOKLYN BRIDGE RUNWAY SHOW
Not to be outdone by New York Fashion Week, Fashion Indie will be eschewing the traditional fifty-foot runway by hosting a fashion show where models will be strutting across the Brooklyn Bridge. The show is set to be held Tuesday, September 2nd at 6pm and will kick-off Fashion Indie Week Brooklyn. 
“Fashion Indie is known for being outlandish and over the top, and this is no exception,” said Fashion Indie’s leader Daniel Saynt, “We want our fashion week to be extravagant, unorthodox, and influential.” 
Wears from the likes of Brooklyn Royalty, Love Brigade, Zulema Griffin, Mandate of Heaven, New York Couture, and San & Soni will be showcased on the 6000-foot runway.
