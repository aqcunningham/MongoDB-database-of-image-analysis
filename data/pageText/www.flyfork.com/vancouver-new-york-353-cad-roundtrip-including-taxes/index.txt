I'm a regular guy with a day job who likes to travel. What I like even more is finding special flight deals too good to pass up. Sometimes an airline lowers their prices to extreme lows, whether it's because of a glitch (it happens more often than you think) or intentionally for a myriad of reasons. These deals are always posted for a small window of time and they usually go unnoticed. I'm pretty good at finding them; so I created this blog to make sure they don't go to waste.
