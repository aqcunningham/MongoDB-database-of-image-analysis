A small bite of the delicious Big Apple… and ummm… you are hooked for life; for you have eaten the forbidden fruit and you know that! The taste of the city is such that it leaves you wanting more and more. It is no surprise that New York is on the ‘bucket list’ of almost every person on this earth. Located at the southern tip of New York State, New York City is the most populous city in the United States. An alpha city which is an important node in the global economic system, because of its significant global impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. Truly the heartbeat of the world!

There are reasons and many more reasons why I simply love New York City, ever since the first time I stepped off the aircraft and set foot on the JFK Airport. That was a good 13 years back. Time flies and how… but love only increases. In fact what started as infatuation 13 years back, developed into passion and then turned lust with every visit! Can anyone blame me? There’s something new around every corner. New York can change in a minute, much less a day, a month, or a year. I remember a person walking past a street in NYC saying, “This is New York!! An ordinary day can turn into an extraordinary experience in a New York minute.” True that! Despite being the concrete jungle that this great city is, it steals our heart in an instant. Here are my reasons for this innate love and why New York is the must visit destination of a lifetime.

10 Reasons Why I Love New York
24-hour Energetic City
I don’t think there’s any other city on this planet with the energy that New York exudes. There is no competition by far. There’s no denying that New Yorkers actually can do pretty much anything at any time of the day or night. Multiple pharmacy chains (Duane Reade, CVS, Walgreens) have locations throughout the boroughs that always keep the lights on and doors open; continuously running bodegas supply everything from Cheetos to laundry detergent, Hair Party 24 Hours goes beyond its name to offer manis and pedis, massages, waxes and more at any hour, there’s food available at every little nook and corner of the city. Phew! No matter where or when you wander around town, other people are out doing something—some with purpose, some just content to explore. New York’s fast pace, buzzing traffic, hustle and bustle of New Yorkers and tourists, 24-hour life, and the creative spirit is what makes this glorious city one of the most vivacious places in the world.

When people talk about skylines, they’re always imagining New York! Manhattan’s skyline, with its many skyscrapers, is universally recognized as the best. It is home to several of the tallest buildings in the world including the likes of cloud-piercing spires of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. New York may not be the birthplace of the skyscraper, but as of 2011, it had 5,937 high-rise buildings, of which 550 completed structures were at least 330 feet high, both second in the world after Hong Kong, with over 50 completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet. Some noteworthy structures include the Woolworth Building – an early gothic revival skyscraper built with massively scaled gothic detailing, and the Twin Towers (whose absence is being filled by the rising One World Trade Center); which helped cement Manhattan’s skyscraper supremacy throughout the 20th century. Not only does NYC have an entire institution – the Skyscraper Museum, devoted to tall towers, but Gotham is also the birthplace of the word skyscraper.

Inspiration, Creativity, Innovation
Space constraints make New York creative with the cultural hot spots. Thanks to the city’s general sense of crammed-in-ness, planners often seek innovative solutions, reclaiming disused or run-down spaces and transforming them into cultural-landscape enrichments. Socrates Sculpture Park, for example, opened atop a former garbage dump in Long Island City. New York also has a way of inspiring people and giving them a feeling that they can accomplish anything they set out to do. That’s how I feel when I walk the busy streets of NYC. On an ordinary day, you might find inspiration in any place, on the street, in the subway, at a Broadway show or in a sidewalk café. An amazing plethora of inspiring, smart, creative people dwell in the nooks and crannies of this city. Sometimes, even watching someone play violin in a park gives me the sense that this is one place where I can aim for the moon.

Linguistic and Cultural Diversity
This truly is one of greatest attributes of NYC and is most often called America’s melting pot. I remember the first time when I walked the streets of New York; I didn’t feel like alien at all. About 36 percent of New York’s denizens hail from other countries, and you can hear as many as 800 tongues are spoken in the five boroughs. Perhaps New Yorkers may have forgotten more languages than other cities they may have heard of. Guess what, there’s even an 
Endangered Language Alliance
, founded by professors from CUNY, NYU and Columbia to preserve the fragile Garifuna, Mamuju and Nahuatl languages. Just how rich is the city’s oral tradition? Experts think there is more Bukhari spoken here than in its home countries of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Census takers found that a whopping 49 percent of New Yorkers speak something besides English at home, mostly Spanish, but also French Creole, Armenian, or Yiddish. And with multi-languages comes multi-culture as well. Isn’t this simply amazing? Everyone has his or her own New York Story to recount, whether they’re a native, an immigrant or a transplant.

Hungry?! Food is just around the corner
You can eat pretty much anything at any time if you are new in NYC and ask a friend for a suggestion, chances are that he will tell you about this great place that serves mouth-watering food on the next street. In a city with 7,966 sit-down restaurants, countless mom-and-pop takeout shops and hundreds of food trucks, it is no surprise that New Yorkers have access to just about any edible they want, whenever the whim strikes. Late-night or early-morning options in most other towns are limited to whatever’s on the menu at 24-hour diners or fast-food drive-throughs, but NYC’s round-the-clock culinary clout extends far beyond rubbery omelettes and greasy, overcooked french fries. Whatever you are craving for, whatever be the hour, you will find exactly what you want. And as if restaurants and take-outs weren’t enough; for those times when you’re too tired, cold or hungover to venture out, you can dial up one of the 9,056 places that deliver food! Sometimes I think New York City offers so much variety that you could live here your entire life and not eat in every restaurant.

Most number of theaters in the world
New York wins hands down on this one by a long shot because numbers don’t lie. In 2012, the World Cities Culture Report did a survey of 12 key metropolises across the globe, and found that NYC by far has the highest concentration of theaters: 420, with Paris a distant second at 353, Tokyo third at 214 and London, trailing in fourth. And undoubtedly this is one feature of NYC that made me simply love it. No dearth of shows no matter what hour and whatever film!  You will find the movie you have been dying to catch, somewhere if not everywhere. And ofcourse, I haven’t even started on Gotham stages yet, where more than 43,000 performances took place in 2012 alone. And no wonder: Between 
, Off Broadway and Off-Off Broadway, plus marathons for newcomers, like the New York International Fringe Festival and the New York Musical Theatre Festival, one can see countless actors speaking the speech in venues ranging from grand old proscenium houses to downtown parking lots.

Friendly people, always together during crisis
Not only are New Yorkers a great bunch of friendly people, but they also come together in ways small and large after crises. They may be in a rush and boy, they sure are loud, they are called callous and cranky by many, but for anyone who has lived through catastrophes in NYC, they would know that it is an exaggeration. There are countless stories of New Yorkers helping one another. They are friendly and are always eager to help you out. During my first visit, there were many times I would ask for directions and there would be a number of people who would help me out. Sometimes, I feel that the city is so big, so loud, so concrete, it’s almost like a beast that everyone has to face together and that’s why people are so helpful and friendly. But when you look at how the city comes together during troubled times, and you know that anyone calling New Yorkers mean or uncaring needs to be dismissed.

Another big reason why I simply love New York City! Each time I take a long stroll in Central Park; I can’t help but think of the impressive beauty that it is. Most people identify Central Park with NYC, but there are so many more to admire. Bryant Park for example, surrounded by tall buildings and at the foot of the second biggest library in the world – was a haven for me when I first started working in the city, because it was a stone’s throw from my office. Fort Tryon Park up at the Cloisters, where you can look across the Hudson and see actual trees, and if you are lucky you could spot Baltimore Orioles among the trees. New York may be a crazy crowded place, but it sure is a city, built with something of a plan. And some plans were definitely made for that most basic of human needs: some peace and quiet. Else, where would you find such tranquility in a concrete city?

Record-breaking Bridges and Tunnels 
Sometimes when I think NYC, the first thought that comes to my mind is the spectacular bridges that this city boasts of. New York City is home to over 2,000 bridges and tunnels which are managed by several agencies. Many of the city’s major bridges and tunnels have broken or set records. The Holland Tunnel was the world’s first vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927. The Brooklyn Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, George Washington Bridge, and Verrazano–Narrows Bridge were the world’s longest suspension bridges when opened in 1883, 1903, 1931, and 1964 respectively. The city features bridges of all lengths and types, carrying vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian, and subway traffic. Ten bridges and one tunnel serving the city have been awarded some level of landmark status. The Holland Tunnel, for example, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993, in recognition of its pioneering role as the first mechanically ventilated vehicular underwater tunnel. The George Washington, High Bridge, Hell Gate, Queensboro, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Macombs Dam, Carroll Street, University Heights, and Washington bridges have all received landmark status as well. My all-time favorite ofcourse is the Brooklyn Bridge. It is an elegant reminder of New York’s history of architectural innovation. And, I have lost count of the number of films that have been shot on this iconic piece!

Undoubtedly, it is a cent percent fact that there’s more competition in New York than in most other cities. But it is a bigger fact that NYC is a land of opportunity. If you have it in you, you can make it big. You can come here with a dream and work hard to achieve it. I can vouch that dreams do indeed come true here every single day, not just basis my conviction after working here. But one does hear countless success stories of people who came to NYC with nothing in their pockets and turned into millionaires. And I am not just referring to the corporate world. There is opportunity at every corner; one just has to look in the right place. It is truly the land of achievers, the land of the American Dream!

If given a choice, I would love to live in this fast-paced city. For one I can tell you, that the city spoils its people, It’s only when you leave NYC, you realize that the rest of the world lives differently and on a more normal schedule. But then that is the character of New York and what is it known for. You never run out of new things to do, dishes to eat, places to visit, or people to meet. NYC is an ever-evolving city, and that’s the beauty of living here. Three cheers for this amazing city (with another amazing skyline picture  because pictures speak a thousand words, as the eise men say!!).

One who is born with wings has many stories to tell. I was a born wayfaring story-teller! But then, how does a chirpy story-teller who also has wings on her back and wheels on her feet find a colossal audience to recount those sometimes awe-inspiring, sometimes eccentric encounters. I realised there was no other way I could narrate my tales to the world unless i started penning them down in black and white. That's how TravelwithArchie was born. 
I love calling myself a vagabond! One who dreams about places and then travels there to see how they look in the real world. Come, borrow my wings for a while and see the world with my lens!
