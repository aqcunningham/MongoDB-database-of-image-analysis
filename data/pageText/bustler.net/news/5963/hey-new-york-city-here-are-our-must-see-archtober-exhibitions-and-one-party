Photo credit: Jörg Schubert/
New Yorkers know it's that time of the year again when the days are getting shorter, the mornings a bit crisper, and a flood of outstanding architecture and design events is about to hit the city: 
For the seventh year in a row, Archinect & Bustler are proud to present the city-wide festival with its packed roster of exhibitions, lectures, conferences, films, and tours across the five boroughs. 
From Archtober's lengthy 
, we'll be presenting weekly highlights starting on Monday. 
For today's post, we've put together a handy guide of some of the key exhibitions (
and one party co-hosted by Archinect!
) you should certainly not miss.
Never Built New York, installation view at the Queens Museum.
Queens Museum, now open until February 18
Co-curated by Sam Lubell and Greg Goldin, and designed by Christian Wassmann,

By presenting four subject-specific projects – After Oil, Of Oil and Ice, Pacific Aquarium and Trash Peaks –

Center for Architecture, October 2 - January 18
Hiding in plain sight, scaffolding is ubiquitous in New York City, yet so underappreciated. The exhibition takes a look at its history, its potential as a kit-of-parts technology, and even had OMA partner Shohei Shigematsu reimagine the Center's architectural space through an installation of actual scaffolding.

5x5: Participatory Provocations
Center for Architecture, now open until October 31
Also at the Center right now is this exhibition that invited 25 young architects to respond to various prompts –  some controversial – and create physical expressions or even provocations. The list of participating firms includes Snarkitecture, Formlessfinder, SOFTlab, Platform for Architecture + Research, Ultramoderne, among others.

Sonic Arcade: Shaping Space with Sound
Museum of Arts and Design, now open until February 25
Don't miss this exciting show at MAD featuring artists, designers, and performers who explore how the ephemeral and abstract nature of sound can be made material, thus helping to reorient "the body to consider spatial and interpersonal relationships anew."

Art and China after 1989: Theater of the World
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, October 6 - January 7
The Guggenheim is hosting an ambitious show (reportedly the largest show of this subject ever mounted in North America) that looks at the contemporary art coming out of China between 1989 and 2008 – arguably the country's most transformative period in its modern history, spanning from the Tiananmen Square protests all the way to the euphoria surrounding the Beijing Olympics.
