The new build is now open and it sucks badly :( It looks so good in the pictures but it has no flow whatsover, is cramped as hell, and overflooded with scooters and their parents. Not even any flatland! Never going back again. Why did they have to get rid of the old one? It was so good...alas, now history.
Needs new ramps and pretty boring compared to other parks, needs to be a bit like shepparton skatepark or kyabram, it's nice n quiet but boring wen u cant go to any other skateparks only this one, new ramps that are not metal n a skatepark that you can enjoy, I always go here n I cant learn nothing mew because the ramps r to small to land tricks on, the box is good n rails, they should make the skatepark either wider or longer, or either make another skatepark somewhere else in tatura, kids cant have fun if the skatepark isnt enjoyable, kinda dangerous...hopefully one day they improve the skatepark to make bigger hips and ramps and to get more air on, anyone want to talk to me about it I'll possibly at the tatura skatepark almost every day, just give me a notice, someone really needs to progress a better skatepark here in my own town....TATURAðŸ˜•â˜¹ðŸ˜”
Pretty fucken small and slippery as shit but not too bad for a quick sesh
There are two great events coming up at the Millthorpe Skate Park during the School Holidays. On Sunday Oct 7th there is a free skate coaching session for skateboarders, scooter riders and bmx riders. 
On Sat 13th October come and join the Millthorpe community in painting the entire skate surface, in preparation for some niche street artworks being put on by professional street artist Kris Lear of 8aesthetix, and some Millthorpe locals. Free BBQ provided.
