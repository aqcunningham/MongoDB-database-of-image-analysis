 Three of Our Favorite Vacation Destinations in the USA					
The United States of America is one of the most popular travel destinations in the world. With so many diverse landscapes and environments, itâ€™s no wonder 77.6 million people visit every year.
However, with so many places to visit and so many great things to do, you would be gone for a lifetime if you tried to see the whole country in one trip. So if youâ€™re struggling to pick a vacation spot, we can hopefully take the effort out of planning your trip.
The following are our three favorite vacation destinations in the USA. We hope theyâ€™ll be yours too!
The Big Apple â€“ New York City
Things You Should Know About Staying in New York City Hotels
The ever-evolving cosmopolitan city of New York is a modern spectacle that every traveler should behold. New York City is known for its impressive skyline of skyscrapers reaching for the heavens, and its diverse culture that comes from a city that was built by an immigrant labor force.
Every borough of New York City is unique. The elite high society and home of capitalism that is Manhattan island, the rugged feel of Brooklyn, Queens and The Bronx, the isolation of the beaches that line Staten Island.
Start your trip to New York by driving over the Brooklyn bridge and into the city. Take a walk through Central Park and gaze in the windows of the luxury stores that line 5th Avenue. Spend your afternoon eating some lunch on the balcony of an iconic hotel and watch the sun fade over the skyline as you sip on a cocktail.
Take to the streets in the evening, stroll down Broadway and take in a show. Visit Times Square and marvel at the neon signs that illuminate the crisp night air. No trip to the United States should end without visiting the worldâ€™s most famous city.
The Ski Slopes of Aspen
Essential Ski Resort Questions for First-Timers and Beginners
Do you dream of a winter wonderland where anything is possible? Aspen is the embodiment of the dream and a literal living snow globe. This mountain town is nestled at the foot of the Rocky Mountain range and the towering snow capped giants lay waiting for you to conquer them.
Spend the day on the slopes and ski lifts, glide down the fresh powder on your snowboard and have some lunch at one of the townâ€™s many amazing restaurants.Â The evenings in Aspen are like something out of a romantic movie. Snuggle up with your partner in front of a roaring log cabin as the warmth spreads through your chalet. Sip on hot chocolate and watch the snow fall slowly to the ground outside.
Aspen is truly magical and has more to offer than just the mountains. Great restaurants, high-end shopping, and interesting museums are all ready and waiting for you to visit them. Aspen is known as the playground of the wealthy and looking at the property on display in the town confirms this as fact.
Beautiful estates and amazing chalets are scattered everywhere. If you love the cold climates of the world, then Aspen is a special place that you have to visit.
The Big Island of Hawaii
How to Choose an Island for Your Trip to Hawaii
Many people have heard about the family vacation destination of Maui, the wonderful intimacy of Kauai, and the surferâ€™s mecca that is the North Shore of Oahu. However, they neglect to mention the islands big brother, the main island of Hawaii.
The Big Island of Hawaii is a tropical paradise that is wild and wonderful. With volcanoes constantly spitting lava into the sea, the island continues to slowly grow with each passing year.
The black volcanic beaches are perfect to relax on as you sip a cocktail. If watersports are your thing, then the Pacific ocean is your playground for diving, snorkeling, surfing, and yachting.
Take a walk through the hiking trails and connect with nature, the amazing diversity of wildlife on the island makes for many beautiful photo opportunities. Visiting the Hawaiian Island chain is an experience you will never forget.

Nice picks! Itâ€™s tough to choose just 3 but all of these would awesome choices for anyone looking to see some of the best the US of A has to offer.  Iâ€™ll just leave this hereâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰ 
Thanks Jim! Definitely tough to only choose 3 from a country as big as the States! I havenâ€™t been to Bozeman â€“ thanks for sharing your post ðŸ™‚
Heading into NYC for *another* house sit tomorrow Meg LOL. One of my fave places on earth. We have completed like 20 or more sits there by now, spending so much time at home in NJ these days. Nowhere in the world close to being like The City, and I find new unexplored areas of the place each time I visit. And I have been there 500 plus times ðŸ˜‰ Awesome list.
Love hearing about your house sits Ryan, such an awesome way to travel and experience unique accommodation as a local! Iâ€™ve only been to NYC a couple of times, so your 500 odd definitely out does me! But it captured my heart even though the time I spent was fleeting ðŸ™‚
Weâ€™ve seen many of the places you mentioned on your list and canâ€™t wait to get to NY!
Definitely need to take in NY if youâ€™re heading back to the States â€“ one of those iconic cities a visit to America canâ€™t go without! ðŸ˜€
Hawaii is a dream destination â€“ I watched Given the Movie last weekend, just bought the LP guide and now trying to work out how I can get Hawaii into our trips that focus on Asia and S America, lol! It might have to remain a dream for a while longer. Great tip about the Big Island though, will check it out.
Nice one, I havenâ€™t seen Given the Movie, so will have to add it to my list of films to check out. 
Hawaiiâ€™s around a 13 hour flight from most of Asia, so a pretty big detour, but you could totally make it happen on your way to S America, and then jump down. Why not right ðŸ˜€
New York and Arizona are my favorite states.  New york is so exciting. Itâ€™s so alive and vibrant. I enjoyed my one month there.
We lived in Arizona for a year, and agree, itâ€™s a beautiful State. Thereâ€™s something about the desert which still calls me. But yes, NYC takes out my top spot because itâ€™s always so darn exciting â€“ no matter how many times you visit! Awesome that you enjoyed a whole month there!
Iâ€™ve never been in Hawaii and Colorado but I do agree with New York! I normally donâ€™t like big cities but NYC has that innate appeal. I guess it has something to do being the most diverse city in the world. That it makes you feel that you have a place in this city. And if you survive there, youâ€™ll survive anywhere.
Iâ€™m actually the same, in not being too phased by big cities, but New York had this magic about it which drew me in. Maybe it is as youâ€™ve said, that in being so diverse, everyone feels as though they have a place. It really is one of the most unique cities in the world ðŸ™‚
Wow I love your list! I loved New York when I was there, but have never been to Aspen. I have to check it out now when I get the chance to see what it is all about. Thanks for the information!
Glad we could inspire you to check out Aspen on your next trip â€“ especially if youâ€™re a fan of snow sports, winter in Aspen is a must not miss!
Never been to USA (yet) but NYC and Hawaii are on my wish list. Thanks to you now I know which Hawaii island I need to pick if I want to see volcanoes. I read posts about Maui and other islands in the past and I was getting worried not to find volcanoes! As usual, thanks for the tips
Glad we could help out, yes, the Big Island of Hawaii is the place to be for volcanoes â€“ Maui is beautiful too, so donâ€™t discount a little island hopping if you have the time (we got married on Maui, stunning spot!), but glad we could point you to the island you were looking for ðŸ™‚
Hard to disagree with these choices, despite the number of other options. I love Aspen, having been a few times. One of my good friends got married there, and renting out the top of Aspen Mountain for their ceremony. It was simply amazing, despite a bit of snow during the June 1st wedding date! Itâ€™s impossible not to be impressed by those views of the valleys and mountains around Aspen.
Thats the problem with the States isnâ€™t it â€“ far too many good choices!! Wow a mountain top wedding in Aspen would have been incredible! Can definitely see it being cold, but definitely one of the most impressive settings for it! Awesome Drew!

Interesting choices.  Glad to see you included the Brooklyn Bridge (my favorite), which was one of the prime reasons that the 5 borough New York City came to be.  Before its completion, Brooklyn was the 4th largest city in the US and Manhattan was a separate city (of New York.)
Absolutely, wouldnâ€™t be a trip to New York without taking in the Brooklyn Bridge! I didnâ€™t know that Brooklyn and Manhattan were separate cities before the bridge came into being. Thanks for the history! ðŸ™‚
Excellent choices. I love the detail you added to them. Iâ€™ve never been to Hawaii before but Iâ€™d like to go someday in the future.
Thanks Rhonda â€“ Iâ€™m glad you enjoyed the post ðŸ™‚ Hope you have the chance to visit Hawaii at some stage â€“ itâ€™s an incredible destination â€“ really unique to the rest of the States.
USA us indeed a silver dream for most people who want to visit the country at least once in a lifetime. But I guess most people would rank New York as their first choice. However I would love to get to Hawaii. Literally the stuff that dreams are made of and of course the main Hawaii island and Maui as well.
Absolutely â€“ and who says you canâ€™t include them both in the one trip right ðŸ˜€
This is a good list! Aspen definitely looks like a good place for holiday and adventure.
The passport requirements for USofA is new to me. Helpful tips there.
Thanks Indrani! Yes, definitely check into the ESTA visa if youâ€™re from a visa waiver country â€“ makes entry into the US a lot easier than lodging paperwork ðŸ™‚
