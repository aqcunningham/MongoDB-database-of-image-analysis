 MORE DECKS TO EXPLORE
SEPARATES THE CELL FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
We chose the bridge because the cell membrane separates the cell from external environment just like a bridge separates two different cities. More functions are transports material in and out of the cell. Allows cellular communication.
FILLS SPACE BETWEEN NUCLEUS AND CELL MEMBRANE
We chose the buildings because they fill up space between the Empire State Building ( nucleus ) and the bridge ( cell membrane ).
STORES AND PROTECTS DNA
We chose midtown Manhattan ( nucleus ) because the Empire State Building ( nucleolus ) is in midtown and the nucleolus is inside the nucleus.
ASSEMBLES RIBOSOMES THAT CONSIST OF PROTEINS AND RNA
We chose the Empire State Building because it's the main attraction in New York, it's the middle of the city and is most known for. Just like the nucleolus is the main part of the cell.
PROVIDES THE CELL SHAPE AND FUNCTION
We chose Central Park because it's filled with many people and cytoskeleton is filled with micro tubes, intermediate filaments, and micro filaments.
BREAKS DOWN TOXINS AND MAKES STEROIDS AND LIPIDS
We chose the subway station to symbolize network of tubules. Help minimize pollution by not using cars which is an example of breaking down toxins.
MANUFACTURES AND PACKS SECRETED PROTEINS
We chose 5th avenue because it's the street in New York that's always busy and making money. Just like the Rough ER it manufactures proteins which proteins in this case meaning clothes or something you can make a profit of.
WHERE PROTEINS ARE MADE
We chose this store because ribosomes are where proteins are made and in this case the candy is made here which symbolizes the proteins.
PROCESSES AND SORTS PROTEINS
We chose this NYC post office to symbolize the Golgi complex because the post office sorts and packages mail and makes sure letters are delivered to the correct addresses. This is similar to the Golgi complex because Golgi processes, sorts, and packages proteins just like a post office.
The New York City transit bus system symbolizes vesicles. The NYC bus system transports/moves people from one place in the city to another and divides them into groups depending on their destination. This is just like vesicles in the way that they divide and transport materials from the cytoplasm.
POWERPLANT AND SUPPLIES ENERGY
I chose Union Square Cafe, a famous New York restaurant, instead of a typical power plant because it supplies New Yorkers with food and energy. Once people go to consume their nutritional energy the sugars and carbs are then broken down in their bodies and used for energy output.
MAINTAINS CELL SHAPE AND STORES WASTE AND PIGMENTS
I chose a NYC bar because it contains water and other liquids. Bottles of liquid in the bar take up much of the space and provide a structure in and under the bar just like vacuoles take up space in the cell. The bar also stores food (nutrients), is colorful (pigments), and has trash which represents the waste.
BREAKS DOWN PROTEINS, NUCLEIC ACIDS, CARBOHYDRATES,& LIPIDS
We chose the NYC landfill/recycling center to represent lysosomes. This landfill and recycling center breaks down trash and un-needed items or recycles them, just like lysosomes break down proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Lysosomes also destroy old organelles, waste, and invaders like the waste recycling center destroys waste.
PROTECTS CELL MEMBRANE
We chose the the rivers surrounding New York to symbolize the cell wall. They protect the city making it nearly impossible for invaders to gain access and because it gives the city shape the way that the cell wall gives the cell shape.
CARRIES OUT PHOTOSYNTHESIS 
Solar panels convert the energy of the sun into electrical energy, which is similar to how chloroplasts of a plant cell change solar energy to chemical energy for cells to use.
CENTRIOLES & CENTROSOMES
MAKES MICROTUBULES AND HELOS IN ANIMAL CELL DIVISION
We chose Madison Square Garden because the ticket takers and ushers are like centrioles and centrosomes because they divide up the crowd as they enter the stadium and guide people to their seats. Centrioles and centrosomes are part of cell division, just like the workers divided up the crowd. They are composed up of many proteins which are the stadium's visitors(proteins).
