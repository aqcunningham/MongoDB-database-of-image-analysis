 MORE DECKS TO EXPLORE
SEPARATES THE CELL FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
We chose the bridge because the cell membrane separates the cell from external environment just like a bridge separates two different cities. More functions are transports material in and out of the cell. Allows cellular communication.
FILLS SPACE BETWEEN NUCLEUS AND CELL MEMBRANE
We chose the buildings because they fill up space between the Empire State Building ( nucleus ) and the bridge ( cell membrane ).
STORES AND PROTECTS DNA
We chose midtown Manhattan ( nucleus ) because the Empire State Building ( nucleolus ) is in midtown and the nucleolus is inside the nucleus.
ASSEMBLES RIBOSOMES THAT CONSIST OF PROTEINS AND RNA
We chose the Empire State Building because it's the main attraction in New York, it's the middle of the city and is most known for. Just like the nucleolus is the main part of the cell.
PROVIDES THE CELL SHAPE AND FUNCTION
We chose Central Park because it's filled with many people and cytoskeleton is filled with micro tubes, intermediate filaments, and micro filaments.
BREAKS DOWN TOXINS AND MAKES STEROIDS AND LIPIDS
We chose the subway station to symbolize network of tubules. Help minimize pollution by not using cars which is an example of breaking down toxins.
MANUFACTURES AND PACKS SECRETED PROTEINS
We chose 5th avenue because it's the street in New York that's always busy and making money. Just like the Rough ER it manufactures proteins which proteins in this case meaning clothes or something you can make a profit of.
WHERE PROTEINS ARE MADE
We chose this store because ribosomes are where proteins are made and in this case the candy is made here which symbolizes the proteins.
PROCESSES AND SORTS PROTEINS
POWERPLANT AND SUPPLIES ENERGY
MAINTAINS CELL SHAPE AND STORES WASTE AND PIGMENTS
BREAKS DOWN PROTEINS, NUCLEIC ACIDS, CARBOHYDRATES,& LIPIDS
PROTECTS CELL MEMBRANE
