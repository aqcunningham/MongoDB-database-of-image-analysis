Live Jazz Night In Akasaka- Summertime !
Join us to enjoy jazz together, You don't always have to be a jazz expert. As far as you are interested in jazz, there would be no problem for you to join in this group. Conversation among our members is not limited in jazz related things only, but it should be anything around our life. Mentally grown people are many among jazz fans, life could be fun with more nice people.
The organizer, Jey's piano trio band often plays at jazz bars in Tokyo. This group's jazz party events are also often held then. Other than live jazz parties, we are enjoying jazz related events with good food and drinks.
