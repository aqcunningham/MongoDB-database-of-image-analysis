That’s the question that we’ve been asking 6sqft’s friends and Twitter followers leading up to Thanksgiving. It’s easy to get pulled into the NYC complaining vortex (The 6 train is delayed 
?! You’re raising my rent 
 much?!), but the reality is that we live in the greatest city in the entire world, and there’s plenty here to be thankful for, whether it’s something as small as seeing a cute dog on the street or as large as visiting famous museums.
 No matter where you’re from, you can find a community of friends that feel like home.
 most certainly the constant energy here, keeps me motivated!

Central park; It’s such an amazing escape from the craziness of NYC, and running in the park is my favorite thing to do. Also, 
all of the dogs I meet on the street every day.

Within this huge, hard, impersonal city there is so much community & kindness.

I’m thankful for those moments that surprise you, like the intimate tranquility of the viewing garden at the Frick Collection. In a city defined by bricks and mortar, it’s an unexpected and tranquil respite. And right now, I’m thankful for the people coming together
