Brooklyn Bridge Walking Tour
The 2.1 km stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge makes a great walking tour with unparalleled views of the New York Skyline
     The Brooklyn Bridge stretches towards Manhattan and a beautiful sunset 
For a true Big Apple experience, spend a sunny afternoon strolling across the Brooklyn Bridge, one of the most iconic landmarks in New York City for over 125 years.  Completed in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge crosses the East River connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.
                The timeless beauty of its Gothic-inspired stone pylons and sweeping steel cables has inspired many, including Walt Whitman, Frank Sinatra and Georgia O'Keefe.  the Brooklyn Bridge Walk allows visitors to follow in their footsteps for a unique vantage point to appreciate the breathtaking New York City skyline with unrivalled views of the 
                  Starting your walk from Brooklyn offers a more dramatic perspective, while beginning in Manhattan may be more convenient. Departing on either end, the walkway offers 1.3 miles of outstanding photo opportunities, so bring your camera and plan on spending at least one hour.  Remember to dress for the weather and wear comfortable shoes; the wood plank walkway is not high heel friendly.  Sightseers should stay within the designated pedestrian area and be mindful of cyclists.
                  There are no facilities or food vendors available on the Brooklyn Bridge Walk, but you can enjoy a treat of Brooklyn Ice Cream (1 Water St) or enjoy a world-famous slice at Grimaldi's (19 Old Fulton Street).  On the Manhattan side, it is a short walk to South Street Seaport for a wide variety of dining options (Pier 17, Fulton and South Street).

 Great place to come and explore when I'm feeling touristy. Its lovely and the view is great but definitely not for those who are bothered by big crowds - if that's not your thing come explore during the week rather than the weekends!

 What a Wonderful Experience. You might think it's a Long walk, but before you know it, you're in the other side. A real Must. Lot's of people so be prepared. Take time to enjoy the Views!!! Enjoy!

 it is very hard to say anything in words that will bring Justice to the Experience on the Brooklyn Bridge. I highly recommend if you are physically able to walk the Brooklyn Bridge for an experience like no other. While you doing that stop to appreciate the beauty of the city behind and take a lot of pictures.

 Though this is a high traffic bridge with many people, it is totally worth the trip. Be mindful of bikers on the path. Great place to get to know other people. Stop by every so often and observe the surroundings. You can see many places from this bridge. One of my interesting things to do is to take some time and look at the age of the steel and ropes of the old bridge. Looking at the bridge structure you can really see the power of the bridge. About halfway through the bridge on the south side you can see the statute of liberty. Great scenery for pictures and videos. This would be and ideal location for wedding photography, or proposals. Iâ€™d like to bring your attention to the mid half of the bridge. The area that exposes almost every side of the city. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

 What a wonderful place to meander about enjoying all of the diverse faces from around the globe. We were there at the perfect time to witness the sunset on a delightful day. This is certainly something to put on your list of things to do when visiting Brooklyn. Quite memorable and highly enjoyable.
