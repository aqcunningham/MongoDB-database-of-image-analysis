Hi friends , hope u r having a good time  ...

I thought of putting a rhyming title for this also , and in the process came to know that : -
No word in the English language rhymes with purple, orange, month or silver (OMG)

The thin white line across the middle of picture is actually decaying&lt;b&gt; contrails &lt;/b&gt; made by a rocket . 
&lt;b&gt;

Thank you friends for all your lovely comments and feedbacks ...
Have a wonderful week ahead

Earlier this week in a new experimental newsletter I’ve been helping Danny Crichton on, we briefly discussed transit pundit Jarrett Walker’s article in The Atlantic arguing against the view that ridesharing and microtransit will be the future of mass transit. Instead, his thesis is that a properly operated and well-resourced bus system is much more efficient from a coverage, cost, space, and equality perspective.

Consider this an ongoing discussion about Urban Tech, its intersection with regulation, issues of public service, and other complexities that people have full PHDs on.  I’m just a bitter, born-and-bred New Yorker trying to figure out why I’ve been stuck in between subway stops for the last 15 minutes, so please reach out with your take on any of these thoughts: @Arman.Tabatabai@techcrunch.com.

From an output perspective, Walker argues that by operating along variable routes based on at-your-door pick ups, microtransit actually takes more time to pick up fewer people on average. Walker also gives buses the edge from a cost and input perspective, since labor makes up 70% of transit operating costs in a pre-autonomous world and buses allow you to service more customers for the price of one driver.

“The driver’s time is far more expensive than maintenance, fuel, and all the other costs involved.  In almost every public meeting I attend, citizens complain about seeing buses with empty seats, lecturing me about how smaller vehicles would be less wasteful. But that’s not the case. Because the cost is in the driver, a wise transit agency runs the largest bus it will ever need during the course of a shift. In an outer suburb, that empty big bus makes perfect sense if it will be mobbed by schoolchildren or commuters twice a day.”

But transit is not solely an issue of volume and unit economics, but one of managing public space. Walker explains that to ensure citizens don’t use more than their fair share of space, cities can either provide vehicles that are only marginally bigger than a human body, i.e. bikes and scooters, or have many people share large-scale vehicles, i.e. mass transit. Doing the latter through a mass fleet of on-demand microtransit solutions, Walker argues, increases congestion and makes it harder to manage scheduling and allocate infrastructure.

While the article offers an effective comparison of unit economics and acts as a useful primer on the various considerations for city transit agencies, some of the conclusions are a bit binary.  The discussion is a bit singular in its focus of microtransit as a replacement of public transit rather than an additive service and doesn’t give much credit to the trip planning and space management capabilities of many microtransit services, nor changes in consumer expectations towards transportation.

But despite some of the gaps in the piece, Walker highlights two ideas that spill over to some broad areas that have caught my interest lately: Tolls and Parking.

Tolls

“To succeed, microtransit would have to help people get around cities better, not just make them feel good about hailing a ride on a phone. Full automation of vehicles, if indeed it ever arrives, might solve the labor problem—although it would put thousands of drivers out of work. But the congestion problem will remain.”

Like many, Walker argues that ridesharing aggravates city traffic rather than alleviates it.  Even though ridesharing’s long-term impact on traffic is widely contested, nearly everyone agrees that a solution to urban congestion is desperately needed.

What’s interesting is that regardless of the discourse that surrounds them, trends in US tolling mechanisms seem to suggest American cities may be moving closer to congestion pricing methods.

As an example, solutions to congestion are top of mind behind the New York state election that saw Democrats taking control of both state legislative houses. Though it seems like the argument resurfaces every few years, the elections have brought renewed debate over the possible implementation of congestion pricing in New York City.  In essence, congestion pricing is a system where drivers would pay higher prices for using high-traffic streets or entering high-traffic zones, allowing cities to better dictate the flow of drivers and reduce congestion.   

Outside of the obvious political tension created by effectively implementing a new tax, some lawmakers have pushed back on the effectiveness of a congestion pricing policy, with some arguing that it can aggravate income inequality or that a policy addressing construction and pedestrians, rather than vehicles, would have a bigger impact on traffic.

However, over the past year or so, an increasing number of states have been rolling out highway tolls that are priced dynamically, instead of using traditional fixed-price tolls. The exact drivers behind the toll prices vary, with some cities charging prices based on traffic conditions and others charging varying prices for the use of express and HOV lanes.

Several new technologies and companies have also made it easier for local governments to implement more sophisticated, adjustable toll pricing or congestion fees at a much lower cost. In the past, congestion pricing systems around the world have required physical detection systems that can be extremely costly to implement.

Now, companies like ClearRoad are helping governments use a wide range of connected vehicle technologies to establish and collect road usage pricing from any location without the need for physical infrastructure. Oregon is one geography working with ClearRoad to manage its new opt-in road usage program where the state is able to calculate drivers’ usage of certain roads and their gas consumption, and then reimburse them for gas taxes they’re paying.

So even though people are still screaming at each other in state capitols, it seems like we may be closer to seeing congestion pricing in major cities than we think. And while executing these programs can be difficult and painfully slow (often needing to satisfy city regulations and tax laws forty layers deep), if these smaller-scale programs we’re seeing in the US are actually effective, congestion pricing may be a solution to plug chunky budget gaps, better finance infrastructure projects and replace lost gas tax revenue in an electric vehicle future.

Parking

In his piece, Walker goes back to some basic principles of urban design, highlighting that at their core, functioning cities come down to how millions of people share a comparatively tiny amount of space.  

Walker explains that city dwellers that travel with cars and solo rideshare trips rather than with large-scale shared transit are effectively taking up more than their fair share of public space.  While the argument is made in the context of ridesharing and congestion, the same idea applies to the less-discussed impact mass-transit ridesharing can have on city parking.

At least in the near-term, certain cities have seen ridesharing actually increase vehicle usage rather than reduce it (a claim rideshare companies dispute), resulting in an even wider gap between the supply and demand for available parking spots.  And if people are using ridesharing but still choosing to own cars regardless, in an indirect fashion, they are similarly reducing the stock of available parking space by more than their fair share.

And while it makes sense that rideshare vehicles should receive a larger portion of the parking stock, given that it serves more passengers, the use of available parking by these vehicles can and has caused tension with local residents that have to store their cars further away.

There are companies like the mobility-focused data platform, Coord, that are working on tools geared towards helping cities and citizens more effectively allocate and plan parking strategies for the future multi-modal transportation network. And theoretically, ridesharing should reduce the number of vehicles in search of parking in the long-term. But at least for now, the impact on parking congestion is just another unintended consequence that weakens the argument for ridesharing as mass transit.

Earlier this week in a new experimental newsletter I’ve been helping Danny Crichton on, we briefly discussed transit pundit Jarrett Walker’s article in The Atlantic arguing against the view that ridesharing and microtransit will be the future of mass transit. Instead, his thesis is that a properly operated and well-resourced bus system is much more efficient from a coverage, cost, space, and equality perspective.

Consider this an ongoing discussion about Urban Tech, its intersection with regulation, issues of public service, and other complexities that people have full PHDs on.  I’m just a bitter, born-and-bred New Yorker trying to figure out why I’ve been stuck in between subway stops for the last 15 minutes, so please reach out with your take on any of these thoughts: @Arman.Tabatabai@techcrunch.com.

From an output perspective, Walker argues that by operating along variable routes based on at-your-door pick ups, microtransit actually takes more time to pick up fewer people on average. Walker also gives buses the edge from a cost and input perspective, since labor makes up 70% of transit operating costs in a pre-autonomous world and buses allow you to service more customers for the price of one driver.

“The driver’s time is far more expensive than maintenance, fuel, and all the other costs involved.  In almost every public meeting I attend, citizens complain about seeing buses with empty seats, lecturing me about how smaller vehicles would be less wasteful. But that’s not the case. Because the cost is in the driver, a wise transit agency runs the largest bus it will ever need during the course of a shift. In an outer suburb, that empty big bus makes perfect sense if it will be mobbed by schoolchildren or commuters twice a day.”

But transit is not solely an issue of volume and unit economics, but one of managing public space. Walker explains that to ensure citizens don’t use more than their fair share of space, cities can either provide vehicles that are only marginally bigger than a human body, i.e. bikes and scooters, or have many people share large-scale vehicles, i.e. mass transit. Doing the latter through a mass fleet of on-demand microtransit solutions, Walker argues, increases congestion and makes it harder to manage scheduling and allocate infrastructure.

While the article offers an effective comparison of unit economics and acts as a useful primer on the various considerations for city transit agencies, some of the conclusions are a bit binary.  The discussion is a bit singular in its focus of microtransit as a replacement of public transit rather than an additive service and doesn’t give much credit to the trip planning and space management capabilities of many microtransit services, nor changes in consumer expectations towards transportation.

But despite some of the gaps in the piece, Walker highlights two ideas that spill over to some broad areas that have caught my interest lately: Tolls and Parking.

Tolls

“To succeed, microtransit would have to help people get around cities better, not just make them feel good about hailing a ride on a phone. Full automation of vehicles, if indeed it ever arrives, might solve the labor problem—although it would put thousands of drivers out of work. But the congestion problem will remain.”

Like many, Walker argues that ridesharing aggravates city traffic rather than alleviates it.  Even though ridesharing’s long-term impact on traffic is widely contested, nearly everyone agrees that a solution to urban congestion is desperately needed.

What’s interesting is that regardless of the discourse that surrounds them, trends in US tolling mechanisms seem to suggest American cities may be moving closer to congestion pricing methods.

As an example, solutions to congestion are top of mind behind the New York state election that saw Democrats taking control of both state legislative houses. Though it seems like the argument resurfaces every few years, the elections have brought renewed debate over the possible implementation of congestion pricing in New York City.  In essence, congestion pricing is a system where drivers would pay higher prices for using high-traffic streets or entering high-traffic zones, allowing cities to better dictate the flow of drivers and reduce congestion.   

Outside of the obvious political tension created by effectively implementing a new tax, some lawmakers have pushed back on the effectiveness of a congestion pricing policy, with some arguing that it can aggravate income inequality or that a policy addressing construction and pedestrians, rather than vehicles, would have a bigger impact on traffic.

However, over the past year or so, an increasing number of states have been rolling out highway tolls that are priced dynamically, instead of using traditional fixed-price tolls. The exact drivers behind the toll prices vary, with some cities charging prices based on traffic conditions and others charging varying prices for the use of express and HOV lanes.

Several new technologies and companies have also made it easier for local governments to implement more sophisticated, adjustable toll pricing or congestion fees at a much lower cost. In the past, congestion pricing systems around the world have required physical detection systems that can be extremely costly to implement.

Now, companies like ClearRoad are helping governments use a wide range of connected vehicle technologies to establish and collect road usage pricing from any location without the need for physical infrastructure. Oregon is one geography working with ClearRoad to manage its new opt-in road usage program where the state is able to calculate drivers’ usage of certain roads and their gas consumption, and then reimburse them for gas taxes they’re paying.

So even though people are still screaming at each other in state capitols, it seems like we may be closer to seeing congestion pricing in major cities than we think. And while executing these programs can be difficult and painfully slow (often needing to satisfy city regulations and tax laws forty layers deep), if these smaller-scale programs we’re seeing in the US are actually effective, congestion pricing may be a solution to plug chunky budget gaps, better finance infrastructure projects and replace lost gas tax revenue in an electric vehicle future.

Parking

In his piece, Walker goes back to some basic principles of urban design, highlighting that at their core, functioning cities come down to how millions of people share a comparatively tiny amount of space.  

Walker explains that city dwellers that travel with cars and solo rideshare trips rather than with large-scale shared transit are effectively taking up more than their fair share of public space.  While the argument is made in the context of ridesharing and congestion, the same idea applies to the less-discussed impact mass-transit ridesharing can have on city parking.

At least in the near-term, certain cities have seen ridesharing actually increase vehicle usage rather than reduce it (a claim rideshare companies dispute), resulting in an even wider gap between the supply and demand for available parking spots.  And if people are using ridesharing but still choosing to own cars regardless, in an indirect fashion, they are similarly reducing the stock of available parking space by more than their fair share.

And while it makes sense that rideshare vehicles should receive a larger portion of the parking stock, given that it serves more passengers, the use of available parking by these vehicles can and has caused tension with local residents that have to store their cars further away.

There are companies like the mobility-focused data platform, Coord, that are working on tools geared towards helping cities and citizens more effectively allocate and plan parking strategies for the future multi-modal transportation network. And theoretically, ridesharing should reduce the number of vehicles in search of parking in the long-term. But at least for now, the impact on parking congestion is just another unintended consequence that weakens the argument for ridesharing as mass transit.

And lastly, some reading while in transit:

<div class="description" title="Best viewed &amp;gt; &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id&#x3D;439819305&amp;amp;size&#x3D;Large&quot;&gt;&#x27;Baddesley Clinton - Moated Manor House&#x27; On Black&lt;/a&gt;
The moated manor house of Baddesley Clinton (grid reference SP199714), just north of the historic town of Warwick in the English county of Warwickshire, was probably established sometime in the 13th century. When large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland, this large fortified manor house was probably also built.

In 1438, John Brome, the Under Treasurer of England, bought the manor. It then passed to his son, Nicholas, who is thought to have built the East Range, which is the main entrance. Nicholas is also responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby church of St Michael&#x27;s, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edmond Ferrers. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust. Henry Ferrers &amp;quot;The Antiquary&amp;quot; (1549-1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family&#x27;s coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. He is likely responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the East Range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building. In the 19th century, the house&#x27;s Catholic Chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael&#x27;s Church, which shares much history with the house, and is wonderful to visit in its own right, is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used.

When large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland, this large fortified manor house was probably also built.</p>&nbsp;<p>In 1438, John Brome, the Under Treasurer of England, bought the manor. It then passed to his son, Nicholas, who is thought to have built the East Range, which is the main entrance. Nicholas is also responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby church of St Michael's, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edmond Ferrers. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust. Henry Ferrers &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1549-1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family's coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. He is likely responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the East Range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building. In the 19th century, the house's Catholic Chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael's Church, which shares much history with the house, and is wonderful to visit in its own right, is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used. The stained glass throughout is also a nice feature.</p></p>

The Saltee Islands, consisting of the Great and Little Saltee, St. Georges Channel are situated approximately 5 kilometres off the coast of Kilmore Quay Co.Wexford Ireland. The larger island Great Saltee is the most famous bird sanctuary in Ireland and is very popular with both day-trippers and birdwatchers. These Islands are privately owned and are one of the world&#x27;s major bird sanctuaries.

The Saltees are a haven for sea birds, nurturing an impressive array of birds, from Gannets and Gulls to Puffins and Manx Shearwaters. They also lie on an important migratory route and a popular stopping-off place for spring and autumn migrants. The Great Saltee also has a breeding population of Grey Seals, one of the very few in eastern Ireland. Up to 120 animals are present in autumn and up to 20 pups are produced annually. 

These Islands are among the ancient islands of Europe, based on Pre-Cambrian bedrock i.e. between 600 and 2000 million years old. There is archaeological evidence that Neolithic man settled there, and traces of religious settlements exist. There is also evidence of buccaneering and smuggling. A flourishing period in the history of the islands was from about 1500 - 1800 when they were a base for pirates, wreckers and smugglers. The gains of the wreckers and smugglers could very well be hidden in the many caves which have mysterious and romantic names - Lady Walker&#x27;s Cave, Happy Hole, Otter&#x27;s Cave and Hell Hole, enough for any Treasure Island. These and other caves can be clearly seen on The Great Saltee Map (Information Page).

The waters around the islands can be treacherous, hence the area is know as the &amp;quot;Graveyard of a Thousand Ships&amp;quot; and the islands their tombstones.

One of the most spectacular sights on the Saltees in mid-Summer are the sea birds colonies on the cliffs to the north-east of the Gannet headland. Vast numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills pack the ledges and create a frightful incessant din which only at night abates a little. The Fulmars too play their part in this splendour. Towards dusk the sight of the Puffins congregating in small groups near their nestling sites presents a marvellous sight. 

If the Saltees had any other name before their present title, it has been long lost. As for the origin of the name there are two possible theories, Norse or of Old or Middle English derivation. However the name suggests a Norse origin (Salt ey - salt island) derived from the phenomenon of the salty spray which sweeps across the islands at times of high winds and waves, especially during the winter. 

Since December 1943 the Saltees are privately owned by the Neale family. Prince Michael the First died in January 1998 and is buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay, Co.Wexford. He has been succeeded by his eldest son Michael the Second. 

Permission for day visits to the Great Saltee, by courtesy of the Neale family, is not needed. Permission to visit the Little Saltee can not be granted due to the hazardous landing conditions.  However we would like all visitors to respect these islands and in the words of the late Prince Michael the First.

 

 

&amp;quot;All people, young and old, are welcome to come, see and enjoy the Islands, and
 leave them as they found them for the unborn generations to come, see and enjoy.&amp;quot;

                                                                                                           Michael the First
 

 

 

These sentiments expressed and carved in stone welcomes all visitors to these islands, erected above the landing steps on the Great Saltee.">

<div class="description" title="TIME MAGAZINE SEPTEMBER 11 1944............................

Europe had a new royal house last week. In Dublin newspapers appeared a personal pronouncement: &amp;quot;I, Prince Michael Neale, landowner, will assume the title of Prince of the Saltees at the conclusion of the war. Also I wish it to be known that no one will be permitted to enter the Saltee Islands without a permit issued by me.&amp;quot; Anybody caught interfering with the millions of birds or their eggs which inhabit those islands will be severely dealt with.

Prince Michael Neale is Eire&#x27;s No. 1 manufacturer of cattle dip. As a County Wexford farmer&#x27;s son, he used to lie on a cliff top in the long grass and gaze south across St. George&#x27;s Channel to the tiny, haze-blue Saltee Islands. Since his first name was legally Prince, it was easy for a farm boy to daydream: &amp;quot;Some day I&#x27;ll own those islands and become a real prince.&amp;quot; He took to calling the Saltees &amp;quot;Paradise.&amp;quot;

By last year he had sold enough dip to buy the Saltees. He began planting 3,000 trees, developing his domain as a luxury tourist resort. He also talked about recruiting a private army.

But last week Prince Neale had a right royal headache. To a reporter the Dublin prince-presumptive confided: &amp;quot;My wife, a Liverpool woman, is a bit shy about using the title of Princess. . . .&amp;quot; He added thoughtfully: &amp;quot;Anyone who does not call me Prince will be ignored.&amp;quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------

The late Michael the First was both a colourful character and a legend in his own life time. Married to Anne he is survived by his family of five sons and one daughter. Both Michael and Anne are buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay Co.Wexford.

In around the year 1920 the nine year old Michael made a vow to his Mother that one day he would own the Saltees and become their first Prince. Twenty three years later in December 1943 he realised his dream.  However his coronation on the Great Saltee did not take place until July 1956.
 
 
A throne, flag-staff and obelisk were shipped to the Great Saltee, the obelisk bearing a plaque with his likeness in profile. The throne is a memorial to his mother and features a coat of arms and the following inscription: 
 
 
 
&amp;quot;This chair is erected in memory of my mother to whom I made a vow when I was ten years old that one day I would own the Saltee Islands and become the First Prince of the Saltees.  Henceforth my heirs and successors can only proclaim themselves Prince of these Islands by sitting in this chair fully garbed in the robes and crown of the Islands and take the Oath of Succession&amp;quot;  -  Michael the First.
 
 
 
 
One of the first jobs undertook on the Great Saltee was the levelling of a field in the centre of the island as a landing strip for his private airplanes. He was taught to fly by Capt.Darby Kennedy (Weston Aerodrome) and regularly flew his Miles Messenger aircraft to the islands. Between 1945 and 1950 over 34,000 trees and shrubs were planted on the island. The most successful of these were Cordyline Palms, which are flourishing to this day.  
The Newspaper articles worldwide regarding Michel the First are in their hundreds.  
&amp;quot;It was never my intention to make a profit from these islands.  Day visitors are welcome to come and enjoy at no cost.  Bird watchers will always remain welcome.&amp;quot; - Michael the First. 
 
 

 
 
To this day the Neale family have upheld his wishes.

Towards dusk the sight of the Puffins congregating in small groups near their nestling sites presents a marvellous sight. 

If the Saltees had any other name before their present title, it has been long lost. As for the origin of the name there are two possible theories, Norse or of Old or Middle English derivation. However the name suggests a Norse origin (Salt ey - salt island) derived from the phenomenon of the salty spray which sweeps across the islands at times of high winds and waves, especially during the winter. 

Since December 1943 the Saltees are privately owned by the Neale family. Prince Michael the First died in January 1998 and is buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay, Co.Wexford. He has been succeeded by his eldest son Michael the Second. 

Permission for day visits to the Great Saltee, by courtesy of the Neale family, is not needed. Permission to visit the Little Saltee can not be granted due to the hazardous landing conditions.  However we would like all visitors to respect these islands and in the words of the late Prince Michael the First.

 

 

&amp;quot;All people, young and old, are welcome to come, see and enjoy the Islands, and
 leave them as they found them for the unborn generations to come, see and enjoy.&amp;quot;

                                                                                                           Michael the First
 

 

 

These sentiments expressed and carved in stone welcomes all visitors to these islands, erected above the landing steps on the Great Saltee.">
	<p><p>TIME MAGAZINE SEPTEMBER 11 1944............................</p>&nbsp;<p>Europe had a new royal house last week. In Dublin newspapers appeared a personal pronouncement: &quot;I, Prince Michael Neale, landowner, will assume the title of Prince of the Saltees at the conclusion of the war. Also I wish it to be known that no one will be permitted to enter the Saltee Islands without a permit issued by me.&quot; Anybody caught interfering with the millions of birds or their eggs which inhabit those islands will be severely dealt with.</p>&nbsp;<p>Prince Michael Neale is Eire's No. 1 manufacturer of cattle dip. As a County Wexford farmer's son, he used to lie on a cliff top in the long grass and gaze south across St. George's Channel to the tiny, haze-blue Saltee Islands. Since his first name was legally Prince, it was easy for a farm boy to daydream: &quot;Some day I'll own those islands and become a real prince.&quot; He took to calling the Saltees &quot;Paradise.&quot;</p>&nbsp;<p>By last year he had sold enough dip to buy the Saltees. He began planting 3,000 trees, developing his domain as a luxury tourist resort. He also talked about recruiting a private army.</p>&nbsp;<p>But last week Prince Neale had a right royal headache. To a reporter the Dublin prince-presumptive confided: &quot;My wife, a Liverpool woman, is a bit shy about using the title of Princess. . . .&quot; He added thoughtfully: &quot;Anyone who does not call me Prince will be ignored.&quot;</p>&nbsp;<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>&nbsp;<p>The late Michael the First was both a colourful character and a legend in his own life time. Married to Anne he is survived by his family of five sons and one daughter. Both Michael and Anne are buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay Co.Wexford.</p>&nbsp;<p>In around the year 1920 the nine year old Michael made a vow to his Mother that one day he would own the Saltees and become their first Prince. Twenty three years later in December 1943 he realised his dream.  However his coronation on the Great Saltee did not take place until July 1956.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>A throne, flag-staff and obelisk were shipped to the Great Saltee, the obelisk bearing a plaque with his likeness in profile. The throne is a memorial to his mother and features a coat of arms and the following inscription: </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&quot;This chair is erected in memory of my mother to whom I made a vow when I was ten years old that one day I would own the Saltee Islands and become the First Prince of the Saltees.  Henceforth my heirs and successors can only proclaim themselves Prince of these Islands by sitting in this chair fully garbed in the robes and crown of the Islands and take the Oath of Succession&quot;  -  Michael the First.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>One of the first jobs undertook on the Great Saltee was the levelling of a field in the centre of the island as a landing strip for his private airplanes. He was taught to fly by Capt.Darby Kennedy (Weston Aerodrome) and regularly flew his Miles Messenger aircraft to the islands. Between 1945 and 1950 over 34,000 trees and shrubs were planted on the island. The most successful of these were Cordyline Palms, which are flourishing to this day.  </p><p>The Newspaper articles worldwide regarding Michel the First are in their hundreds.  </p><p>&quot;It was never my intention to make a profit from these islands.  Day visitors are welcome to come and enjoy at no cost.  Bird watchers will always remain welcome.&quot; - Michael the First. </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>To this day the Neale family have upheld his wishes.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p> The Saltee Islands, consisting of the Great and Little Saltee, St. Georges Channel are situated approximately 5 kilometres off the coast of Kilmore Quay Co.Wexford. The larger island Great Saltee is the most famous bird sanctuary in Ireland and is very popular with both day-trippers and birdwatchers. These Islands are privately owned and are one of the world's major bird sanctuaries.</p>&nbsp;<p>The Saltees are a haven for sea birds, nurturing an impressive array of birds, from Gannets and Gulls to Puffins and Manx Shearwaters. They also lie on an important migratory route and a popular stopping-off place for spring and autumn migrants. The Great Saltee also has a breeding population of Grey Seals, one of the very few in eastern Ireland. Up to 120 animals are present in autumn and up to 20 pups are produced annually. </p>&nbsp;<p>These Islands are among the ancient islands of Europe, based on Pre-Cambrian bedrock i.e. between 600 and 2000 million years old. There is archaeological evidence that Neolithic man settled there, and traces of religious settlements exist. There is also evidence of buccaneering and smuggling. A flourishing period in the history of the islands was from about 1500 - 1800 when they were a base for pirates, wreckers and smugglers. The gains of the wreckers and smugglers could very well be hidden in the many caves which have mysterious and romantic names - Lady Walker's Cave, Happy Hole, Otter's Cave and Hell Hole, enough for any Treasure Island. These and other caves can be clearly seen on The Great Saltee Map (Information Page).</p>&nbsp;<p>The waters around the islands can be treacherous, hence the area is know as the &quot;Graveyard of a Thousand Ships&quot; and the islands their tombstones.</p>&nbsp;<p>One of the most spectacular sights on the Saltees in mid-Summer are the sea birds colonies on the cliffs to the north-east of the Gannet headland. Vast numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills pack the ledges and create a frightful incessant din which only at night abates a little. The Fulmars too play their part in this splendour.

ARTIST BIOS

Olivier Besson - Movement Artist - is an improvisational movement artist who hails from France and is based in Boston. In the period from 1980 until the mid 90&#x27;s, Olivier studied Contact Improvisation with Robin Feld, Nancy Stark Smith, Lisa Nelson and Andrew Harwood, and Improvisation / Real Time composition with Daniel Lepkoff and Julyen Hamilton. During that time, he also practiced and performed Bugaku (Court dance from Japan) with Arawana Hayashi. Other training includes Butoh with Maureen Feming and Action Theater with Ruth Zaporah.

Most notably, Olivier’s work has been presented: *in the US - at Dance Theatre Workshop (NYC), Judson Church (NYC), New York Improvisation festival, Walker Art Centre (Minneapolis), Boston Dance Umbrella, Florida Dance Festival, Dance Place (Washington DC), The Boston Conservatory, Boston University, Radford University (Virginia), *and internationally - at the National Institute of the Arts (Taipei, Taiwan), Die Pratze (Tokyo), Art of Movement Festival (Yaroslav, Russia), Micadanses (Paris) and with Compagnie Vertige (Nice, France). He has collaborated with many individuals including Chris Aiken, Lisa Schmidt, Debra Bluth, Ming-Shen Ku, Pamela Newell, Toshiko Oiwa and musicians/composers Mike Vargas, Peter Jones, Jane Wang and Grant Smith. Locally, he has guest danced for Dawn Kramer, Micki Taylor-Pinney and Diane Noya. His ongoing performance projects involve collaborations with Liz Roncka in Boston and Emmanuelle Pepin in Nice (France) .

Olivier is currently on faculty at The Boston Conservatory (dance division). He has been on faculty at Canal Danse (Paris), the French National Circus School (CNAC), Bates Dance Festival, Emerson College and the School of Fine Arts at Boston Universtity. He has taught residencies at the National Institute of the Arts (Taipei, Taiwan), Le Centre Choregraphique de Danse / Daniel Larieu (Tours, France), the University of Minnesota, and Radford University (Virginia). He has also taught masterclasses for teen / pre-teen programs at Walnut Hill, Cambridge School of Weston, Jeanette Neil Dance Studios, Brookline High and Cambridge Rindge and Latin. 
Haggai Cohen Milo - At the young age of 25, bass player and composer Haggai Cohen Milo  is already a known name in the international music scene. Mr. Cohen Milo, currently operating from Berkeley, CA, brings exotic flavors to his music from his native middle east country, Israel. In both his compositions and in his playing, there is a contemporary mix of sound between East and West.

<div class="description" title="The moated manor house of Baddesley Clinton (grid reference SP199714), just north of the historic town of Warwick in the English county of Warwickshire, was probably established sometime in the 13th century. When large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland, this large fortified manor house was probably also built.

In 1438, John Brome, the Under Treasurer of England, bought the manor. It then passed to his son, Nicholas, who is thought to have built the East Range, which is the main entrance. Nicholas is also responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby church of St Michael&#x27;s, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edmond Ferrers. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust. Henry Ferrers &amp;quot;The Antiquary&amp;quot; (1549-1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family&#x27;s coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. He is likely responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the East Range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building. In the 19th century, the house&#x27;s Catholic Chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael&#x27;s Church, which shares much history with the house, and is wonderful to visit in its own right, is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used. The stained glass throughout is also a nice feature.">

<div class="description" title="The Saltee Islands, consisting of the Great and Little Saltee, St. Georges Channel are situated approximately 5 kilometres off the coast of Kilmore Quay Co.Wexford. The larger island Great Saltee is the most famous bird sanctuary in Ireland and is very popular with both day-trippers and birdwatchers. These Islands are privately owned and are one of the world&#x27;s major bird sanctuaries.

The Saltees are a haven for sea birds, nurturing an impressive array of birds, from Gannets and Gulls to Puffins and Manx Shearwaters. They also lie on an important migratory route and a popular stopping-off place for spring and autumn migrants. The Great Saltee also has a breeding population of Grey Seals, one of the very few in eastern Ireland. Up to 120 animals are present in autumn and up to 20 pups are produced annually. 

These Islands are among the ancient islands of Europe, based on Pre-Cambrian bedrock i.e. between 600 and 2000 million years old. There is archaeological evidence that Neolithic man settled there, and traces of religious settlements exist. There is also evidence of buccaneering and smuggling. A flourishing period in the history of the islands was from about 1500 - 1800 when they were a base for pirates, wreckers and smugglers. The gains of the wreckers and smugglers could very well be hidden in the many caves which have mysterious and romantic names - Lady Walker&#x27;s Cave, Happy Hole, Otter&#x27;s Cave and Hell Hole, enough for any Treasure Island. These and other caves can be clearly seen on The Great Saltee Map (Information Page).

The waters around the islands can be treacherous, hence the area is know as the &amp;quot;Graveyard of a Thousand Ships&amp;quot; and the islands their tombstones.

One of the most spectacular sights on the Saltees in mid-Summer are the sea birds colonies on the cliffs to the north-east of the Gannet headland. Vast numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills pack the ledges and create a frightful incessant din which only at night abates a little. The Fulmars too play their part in this splendour. Towards dusk the sight of the Puffins congregating in small groups near their nestling sites presents a marvellous sight. 

If the Saltees had any other name before their present title, it has been long lost. As for the origin of the name there are two possible theories, Norse or of Old or Middle English derivation. However the name suggests a Norse origin (Salt ey - salt island) derived from the phenomenon of the salty spray which sweeps across the islands at times of high winds and waves, especially during the winter. 

Since December 1943 the Saltees are privately owned by the Neale family. Prince Michael the First died in January 1998 and is buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay, Co.Wexford. He has been succeeded by his eldest son Michael the Second. 

Permission for day visits to the Great Saltee, by courtesy of the Neale family, is not needed. Permission to visit the Little Saltee can not be granted due to the hazardous landing conditions.  However we would like all visitors to respect these islands and in the words of the late Prince Michael the First.

 

 

&amp;quot;All people, young and old, are welcome to come, see and enjoy the Islands, and
 leave them as they found them for the unborn generations to come, see and enjoy.&amp;quot;

                                                                                                           Michael the First
 

 

 

These sentiments expressed and carved in stone welcomes all visitors to these islands, erected above the landing steps on the Great Saltee.">

&lt;b&gt;Rencontres d&#x27;Arles&lt;/b&gt;
The Rencontres d’Arles (formerly called Rencontres internationales de la photographie d’Arles) is an annual summer photography festival founded in 1970 by the Arles photographer Lucien Clergue, the writer Michel Tournier and the historian Jean-Maurice Rouquette.

The Rencontres d’Arles has an international impact by showing material that has never been seen by the public before. In 2015, the festival welcomed 93,000 visitors.

The specially designed exhibitions, often organised in collaboration with French and foreign museums and institutions, take place in various historic sites. Some venues, such as 12th-century chapels or 19th-century industrial buildings, are open to the public throughout the festival.

The Rencontres d’Arles has revealed many photographers, confirming its significance as a springboard for photography and contemporary creativity.

In recent years the Rencontres d’Arles has invited many guest curators and entrusted some of its programming to such figures as Martin Parr in 2004, Raymond Depardon in 2006 and the Arles-born fashion designer Christian Lacroix.

Events

Opening week at the Rencontres d’Arles features photography-focused events (projections at night, exhibition tours, panel discussions, symposia, parties, book signings, etc.) in the town’s historic venues, some of which are only open to the public during the festival. Memorable events in recent years include Europe Night (2008), an overview of European photography; Christian Lacroix’s fashion show for the festival’s closing (2008); and Patti Smith’s concert for the Vu agency’s 20th anniversary (2006).
Nights at the Roman Theatre

At night, work by a photographer or a photography expert is projected in the town’s open-air Roman theatre accompanied by concerts and performances. Each event is a one-off creation. In 2009, 8,500 people attended evenings at the Roman theatre, an average of 2,000 a night, and 2,500 were there on closing night, when the Tiger Lilies played during a projection of Nan Goldin’s “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency”. In 2013 over 6,000 people attended the nighttime photography projections, an average of approximately 1,000 each night.
The Night of the Year

The Night of the Year, which was created in 2006, allows visitors to walk around and see the festival’s favourite works by artists and photographers as well as carte blanche exhibitions by institutions.
Cosmos-Arles Books

Cosmos-Arles Books is a Rencontres d’Arles satellite event dedicated to new publishing practices.

Over the past 15 years large-scale photographic publications, self-published books, and ebooks have become essential media for experimentation by photographers and artists. They allow photography to be rediscovered as a means of expression and distribution, providing a rich terrain of expression for the art’s fundamentally hybrid forms.
Symposia and panel discussions

Photographers and professionals participating in symposia and panel discussions during opening week discuss their work or issues raised by the images on display. In recent years the themes included whether a black-and-white aesthetic is still conceivable in photography (2013); the impact of social networks on creativity and information (2011); breaking with past, a key idea for photography today (2009); photography commissions: freedom or constraint (2008); challenges and changes in the photography market (2007).
The Rencontres d’Arles awards

Since 2002 the Rencontres d’Arles awards have been an opportunity to discover new talents. In 2007 the number of annual awards was reduced to three, presented at the closing ceremony of the festival’s professional week: the Discovery Award (€25,000), Author’s Book Award (€8,000) and History Book Award (€8,000).
Luma Rencontres Dummy Book Award

In 2015 the Rencontres d’Arles offered an award to assist with the publication of a dummy book. Endowed with a €25,000 budget production budget, this new prize is open to all photographers and artists using photography who submit a dummy book that has never been published.

The winner’s book will be produced in autumn 2015 and be presented at the 2016 Rencontres d’Arles.
Photo Folio Review &amp;amp; Gallery

Since 2006 aspiring photographers have been able to submit their portfolios to international photography experts in various fields, including publishers, exhibition curators, heads of institutions, agency directors, gallery owners, collectors, critics and photo editors, for appraisal during the festival’s opening week. Photo Folio Review &amp;amp; Gallery offers them an opportunity to show their work throughout the festival.
Photography classes

The Rencontres d’Arles has always been a place where professional photographers and practitioners on every level have been able to meet each other and exchange ideas. Each year, photography class participants undertake a personal journey of creation through photography’s aesthetic, ethical and technological issues. Leading photographers such as Guy le Querrec, Antoine d’Agata, Martin Parr, René Burri and Joan Fontcuberta regularly teach at the Rencontres d’Arles.
Rentrée en Images

“Rentrée en Images” has been a key part of the festival’s educational activities since 2004. During the first two weeks in September, special mediators take students from the primary to graduate school level on guided tours of the exhibitions. Based on the festival’s programming, the event aims to introduce young people to the visual arts and fits in with a wider policy of cultural democratisation. “Rentrée en Images” reaches thousands of students, and for many of them it is their first exposure to contemporary art.
Budget

Public funding accounted for 40% of the 2015 festival’s €6.3-million budget, sales (mainly of tickets and derivative products), 40% and private partnerships, 20%[clarification needed][citation needed].

	<p><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>&nbsp;<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p><b>Rencontres d'Arles</b></p><p>The Rencontres d’Arles (formerly called Rencontres internationales de la photographie d’Arles) is an annual summer photography festival founded in 1970 by the Arles photographer Lucien Clergue, the writer Michel Tournier and the historian Jean-Maurice Rouquette.</p>&nbsp;<p>The Rencontres d’Arles has an international impact by showing material that has never been seen by the public before. In 2015, the festival welcomed 93,000 visitors.</p>&nbsp;<p>The specially designed exhibitions, often organised in collaboration with French and foreign museums and institutions, take place in various historic sites. Some venues, such as 12th-century chapels or 19th-century industrial buildings, are open to the public throughout the festival.</p>&nbsp;<p>The Rencontres d’Arles has revealed many photographers, confirming its significance as a springboard for photography and contemporary creativity.</p>&nbsp;<p>In recent years the Rencontres d’Arles has invited many guest curators and entrusted some of its programming to such figures as Martin Parr in 2004, Raymond Depardon in 2006 and the Arles-born fashion designer Christian Lacroix.</p><p>Contents</p>&nbsp;<p>    1 Art directors</p><p>    2 The festival</p><p>    3 The Rencontres d'Arles award winners</p><p>    4 Exhibitions</p><p>    5 References</p><p>    6 External links</p>&nbsp;<p>Art directors</p><p>A photographer, Jean-Pierre Sudre, discussing his work, Rencontres d'Arles, 1975</p>&nbsp;<p>    1970 - 1972: Lucien Clergue, Michel Tournier, Jean-Maurice Rouquette</p><p>    1973 - 1976: Lucien Clergue</p><p>    1977: Bernard Perrine</p><p>    1978: Jacques Manachem</p><p>    1979 - 1982: Alain Desvergnes (fr)</p><p>    1983 - 1985: Lucien Clergue</p><p>    1986 - 1987: François Hébel</p><p>    1988 - 1989: Claude Hudelot (fr)</p><p>    1990: Agnès de Gouvion Saint-Cyr</p><p>    1991 - 1993: Louis Mesplé (fr)</p><p>    1994: Lucien Clergue</p><p>    1995 - 1998, délégué général: Bernard Millet (fr)</p><p>        1995, artistic director: Michel Nuridsany (fr)</p><p>        1996, artistic director: Joan Fontcuberta</p><p>        1997, artistic director: Christian Caujolle (fr)</p><p>        1998, artistic director: Giovanna Calvenzi</p><p>    1999 - 2001: Gilles Mora (fr)</p><p>    2002 - 2014: François Hébel</p><p>    Since 2015: Sam Stourdzé (fr)</p>&nbsp;<p>The festival</p><p>A photography exhibition, Rencontres d'Arles, 2010</p><p>Events</p>&nbsp;<p>Opening week at the Rencontres d’Arles features photography-focused events (projections at night, exhibition tours, panel discussions, symposia, parties, book signings, etc.) in the town’s historic venues, some of which are only open to the public during the festival. Memorable events in recent years include Europe Night (2008), an overview of European photography; Christian Lacroix’s fashion show for the festival’s closing (2008); and Patti Smith’s concert for the Vu agency’s 20th anniversary (2006).</p><p>Nights at the Roman Theatre</p>&nbsp;<p>At night, work by a photographer or a photography expert is projected in the town’s open-air Roman theatre accompanied by concerts and performances. Each event is a one-off creation. In 2009, 8,500 people attended evenings at the Roman theatre, an average of 2,000 a night, and 2,500 were there on closing night, when the Tiger Lilies played during a projection of Nan Goldin’s “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency”. In 2013 over 6,000 people attended the nighttime photography projections, an average of approximately 1,000 each night.</p><p>The Night of the Year</p>&nbsp;<p>The Night of the Year, which was created in 2006, allows visitors to walk around and see the festival’s favourite works by artists and photographers as well as carte blanche exhibitions by institutions.</p><p>Cosmos-Arles Books</p>&nbsp;<p>Cosmos-Arles Books is a Rencontres d’Arles satellite event dedicated to new publishing practices.</p>&nbsp;<p>Over the past 15 years large-scale photographic publications, self-published books, and ebooks have become essential media for experimentation by photographers and artists. They allow photography to be rediscovered as a means of expression and distribution, providing a rich terrain of expression for the art’s fundamentally hybrid forms.</p><p>Symposia and panel discussions</p>&nbsp;<p>Photographers and professionals participating in symposia and panel discussions during opening week discuss their work or issues raised by the images on display. In recent years the themes included whether a black-and-white aesthetic is still conceivable in photography (2013); the impact of social networks on creativity and information (2011); breaking with past, a key idea for photography today (2009); photography commissions: freedom or constraint (2008); challenges and changes in the photography market (2007).</p><p>The Rencontres d’Arles awards</p>&nbsp;<p>Since 2002 the Rencontres d’Arles awards have been an opportunity to discover new talents. In 2007 the number of annual awards was reduced to three, presented at the closing ceremony of the festival’s professional week: the Discovery Award (€25,000), Author’s Book Award (€8,000) and History Book Award (€8,000).</p><p>Luma Rencontres Dummy Book Award</p>&nbsp;<p>In 2015 the Rencontres d’Arles offered an award to assist with the publication of a dummy book. Endowed with a €25,000 budget production budget, this new prize is open to all photographers and artists using photography who submit a dummy book that has never been published.</p>&nbsp;<p>The winner’s book will be produced in autumn 2015 and be presented at the 2016 Rencontres d’Arles.</p><p>Photo Folio Review &amp; Gallery</p>&nbsp;<p>Since 2006 aspiring photographers have been able to submit their portfolios to international photography experts in various fields, including publishers, exhibition curators, heads of institutions, agency directors, gallery owners, collectors, critics and photo editors, for appraisal during the festival’s opening week. Photo Folio Review &amp; Gallery offers them an opportunity to show their work throughout the festival.</p><p>Photography classes</p>&nbsp;<p>The Rencontres d’Arles has always been a place where professional photographers and practitioners on every level have been able to meet each other and exchange ideas. Each year, photography class participants undertake a personal journey of creation through photography’s aesthetic, ethical and technological issues. Leading photographers such as Guy le Querrec, Antoine d’Agata, Martin Parr, René Burri and Joan Fontcuberta regularly teach at the Rencontres d’Arles.</p><p>Rentrée en Images</p>&nbsp;<p>“Rentrée en Images” has been a key part of the festival’s educational activities since 2004. During the first two weeks in September, special mediators take students from the primary to graduate school level on guided tours of the exhibitions.

<div class="description" title="Some seven miles West of Louisburgh, near the villages of Killeen and Killadoon lies Bunlahinch Clapper Footbridge. It is a unique and interesting feature, with an interesting history. The bridge is a low, curving construction, 130ft long, formed of 38 boulders spanned by slabs of stone, and takes walkers across a wide but shallow ford. This picturesque and remarkable Clapper Bridge takes its name from the word Clapper which is the plural for the Anglo-Saxon word &#x27;Clam&#x27; and signifies a construction which is Roman in origin and consists of a row of two uprights crossed by a topping slab.

The area was formerly known locally as &#x27;The Colony&#x27;, but it&#x27;s past is seldom talked about and few are willing to recall the memories of its brief and shameful existence. This is because it was really known as a &amp;quot;Colony of Jumpers&amp;quot;, so called because the village came into being as a result of the practice known as souperism.

During the Famine many local people were forced to convert to protestantism just to gain sustenance. The local Church of Ireland Minister, the Rev. Callinan, was in the habit of providing soup to his congregation, who due to starvation were very vulnerable and so many catholics converted to the protestant faith just to survive.

As his congregation continued to expand, in 1853 Lord Sligo granted him an acre of land seven miles west of Louisbourgh, on which to build a new church. The church was dedicated in Irish and was attended by 300 people. As the location was in an extremely remote area and there were no roads as such, numbers began to fall and the congregation petered out.

The Society for the Protection of Rights of Conscience took control of the church. The Secretary of the Society, a man named Hogan leased a further 193 acres from Lord Sligo and proceed to build ten or twelve two bedroomed houses for the converts together with a school for its inhabitants.

In 1863 John Alexander, who built the &#x27;Clapper Bridge&#x27; across the streams that separated the two rows of houses, replaced Hogan as Secretary of the Society. Much of this effort was in vain however as the local people (other than the converts) strongly objected to the presence of the society and did nothing to encourage their farming endeavours. After only twenty years the society disappeared from the district, although their teacher, a Miss Mc Greal, remained for some years in the living quarters of the school.

Richard King purchased the land in 1878 from Lord Sligo for a figure of £650. Little remains today of the school and all that remains of the colony is the skeleton of 3 houses. The church was demolished in 1927 and all that is left are the entrance gates. The Clapper Bridge remains a unique and unusual monument, to a shameful period of Irish history. Mayo County Council maintains the bridge in unblemished condition.

<div class="description" title="Another post of the Austin Skyline.  This time it&#x27;s over at Lou Neff&#x27;s Point.  
In 2004, we were awarded a $97,976 grant from Texas Parks and Wildlife to widen and restore Lou Neff Point (the hairpin turn where Barton Creek meets Lady Bird Lake).  This notorious “pinch point” was a hot spot for biker/runner/walker collisions due to its change in elevation and narrow passage.  Crumbling retaining walls added to the urgency.  After securing additional funding from Michael &amp;amp; Susan Dell Foundation, Stillwater Foundation, friends of Nancy Kohler and TTF members, work began in April 2006.  The $185,000 project was completed in June 2006.  A heartfelt thank you to Sitio Design and Texas Landscapes and Waterfeatures for their vision and hard work!

<div class="description" title="German postcard by Kunst und Bild, no. I 411. Photo: RKO. Publicity still for &lt;i&gt;Tarzan&#x27;s Hidden Jungle&lt;/i&gt; (Harold D. Schuster, 1955). 

Good-looking and muscular American actor &lt;b&gt;Gordon Scott&lt;/b&gt; (1926–2007) is best known as the eleventh Tarzan. He portrayed Tarzan in five films from 1955 to 1960. Then Scott moved to Italy, where he became a popular star of the Peplum film genre, the sword-and-sandal epics. As the Peplum faded, Scott starred in Spaghetti Westerns and Eurospy films.

Gordon Scott was born Gordon Merrill Werschkul in Portland, Oregon, in 1926. He was  one of nine children of advertising man Stanley Werschkul and his wife Alice. Scott was raised in Oregon and studied Physical Education at the University of Oregon for one semester. Upon leaving school, he joined the U.S. Army in 1944. He served as a drill sergeant and military policeman, and specialized in close order drill, judo and hand-to-hand combat. After his honorable discharge in 1947 he took on a variety of  jobs, including fireman, cowboy, and farm-machinery salesman. In 1953 he was working as a lifeguard at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas when he was spotted by Hollywood agents, Ed and Walter Mayers. They were impressed by his handsome features, muscular physique, and imposing height. Scott then beat out 200 contestants to replace Lex Barker as Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; famous jungle hero Tarzan. Film producer Sol Lesser offered him a 7 year contract, a loin cloth and a new last name. Reportedly, ‘Werschkul’ sounded too much like ‘Weissmuller’. So as Gordon Scott, he debuted in the low-budget Tarzan’s Hidden Jungle (Harold D. Schuster, 1955). It led to a romance with co-star Vera Miles, who became his wife in 1956. They divorced in 1959. Tarzan’s Hidden Jungle was followed by Tarzan and the Lost Safari (H. Bruce Humberstone, 1957), the first Tarzan film in colour. It was filmed in Nairobi, British East Africa. In his early Tarzan films, Scott played the character as unworldly and inarticulate, in the mold of Johnny Weissmuller. In 1958, Sol Lesser sold Scott&#x27;s contract to Sy Weintraub. The new producer took his star to Paramount Pictures and, fueled by bigger production budgets, made two of the most successful Tarzan films, Tarzan&#x27;s Greatest Adventure (John Guillermin, 1959) with Anthony Quayle and Sean Connery, and Tarzan the Magnificent (Robert Day, 1960) with Jock Mahoney. In these later films, Scott played a Tarzan who was educated and spoke perfect English, as in the original Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. Gordon Scott was the only actor to play Tarzan in both styles.

Fearing he would become typecast as Tarzan, Gordon Scott moved to Italy. There he became a popular star of the Peplum genre, the sword-and-sandal epics featuring handsome bodybuilders as various characters from Greek and Roman myth. Scott was an old training buddy of Hercules star Steve Reeves. Reeves had agreed to star in the Sergio Leone-penned saga Romolo e Remo/Duel of the Titans (Sergio Corbucci, 1961) about the two brothers of Roman Mythology, who founded Rome. The producer wanted Reeves to play both Romulus and Remus, but Reeves objected that the film would be more effective with another actor in the role of Remus. He recommended Gordon Scott, and the film co-starred Virna Lisi, Laura Solari, Massimo Girotti  and Jacques Sernas. Scott was given the highest salary he had earned thus far for taking the role. Next followed Maciste alla corte del Gran Khan/Maciste at the Court of the Great Khan (Riccardo Freda, 1961),  which reused the sets, extras and Yoko Tani as a princess from Marco Polo (Piero Pierotti, Hugo Fregonese, 1961) and Freda&#x27;s I mongoli/The Mongols (André De Toth, Leopoldo Savona, Riccardo Freda, 1961). He played Julius Caesar opposite Pascale Petit as Cleopatra in the historical drama Una regina per Cesare/A Queen for Caesar (Piero Pierotti, Victor Tourjansky, 1962) set in Egypt in 48 BC. Unlike other films about Caesar and Cleopatra, this film focuses entirely on the dynastic struggle within Egypt leading up to the arrival of Caesar, and in fact, we only see him in the closing scene of the film when he arrives at The Ptolemaic Palace in Alexandria. 20th Century Fox bought the rights for the film to keep it out of release lest it compete with their own Cleopatra, featuring Elizabeth Taylor. Scott also played Hercules in a couple of international co-productions during the mid-1960s.
 
As the Peplum genre faded, Gordon Scott starred in other genre films. His first Spaghetti Western was Buffalo Bill, l&#x27;eroe del far west/Buffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West (Mario Costa, 1964) with Jan Hendriks. He also starred in the Eurospy film Il Raggio infernale/Danger!! Death Ray (Gianfranco Baldanello, 1967), released at a time when the James Bond films, and spy films in general, were very popular internationally. His early military combat and martial arts training made it possible for him to do many of his own stunts. His final film appearance was in the Spaghetti Western Gli uomini dal passo pesante/The Tramplers (Albert Band,  Mario Sequi, 1966-1968) with Joseph Cotten and Franco Nero. He left Italy, and never made another film. He was trailed by a reputation as a ladies&#x27; man who seldom paid his bills, according to a 1987 article in the Toronto Star. For the last two decades of his life, Scott was a popular guest at film conventions and autograph shows and sold knives. In 2007, Gordon Scott died, aged 80, in Baltimore, Maryland, of lingering complications from multiple heart surgeries earlier in the year. Adam Bernstein in his obituary in The Washington Post:  “He lived with a series of obliging friends and ‘Tarzan’ fans, most recently in Baltimore. He had a troubled marriage to Miles, who apparently was under the impression that she was his first wife. She was his second or third, by varying accounts. He was seldom in contact with his surviving family, which includes a brother and two sisters. He had a son with Miles, and it&#x27;s unclear how many other children he might have had. He was estranged from nearly everyone.” Scott was married three times. His first marriage was with Janice Mae Wynkoop, of Oakland, California. They met when he was a lifeguard at Lake Temescal, located in Oakland, California. The couple married in Reno, Nevada, in 1948, and had one child, Karen Judith Werschkul (1948), before divorcing in 1949. His second marriage was to a woman he met while they were both working at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas. Gordon as a lifeguard and his wife as a PBX operator.  They soon married and had a son, Eric, but the marriage ended once Gordon&#x27;s acting career took off. With Vera Miles, he had one son, Michael, (1957).

&lt;b&gt;Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311&lt;/b&gt;

By Tim Hipps
FMWRC Public Affairs

ALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…

Retired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…

Staff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…

…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.

There were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.

“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”

Winners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp;amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.

Walker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. 

The subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.

“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.

“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”

Walker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.

About five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.

“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”

What does Walker enjoy most about photography?

“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”

Pugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”

Pugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.

“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”

Piedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.

“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”

The subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.

“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”

So what’s real?

“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.

“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”

Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.

“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”

Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. 

“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.

“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”

As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.

“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”

Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” 

Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. 

Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”

Lt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”

Staff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.

	<p><p>PHOTO CAPTION:  Awarded 1st Place Sunset Swim by 1LT CHRISTOPHER SNELL  - Division 1 Active Duty Military</p>&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.Facebook.com/FamilyMWR" rel="nofollow">www.Facebook.com/FamilyMWR</a></p>&nbsp;<p><b>Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311</b></p>&nbsp;<p>By Tim Hipps</p><p>FMWRC Public Affairs</p>&nbsp;<p>ALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…</p>&nbsp;<p>Retired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…</p>&nbsp;<p>Staff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…</p>&nbsp;<p>…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.</p>&nbsp;<p>There were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.</p>&nbsp;<p>“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Winners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.</p>&nbsp;<p>Walker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. </p>&nbsp;<p>The subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.</p>&nbsp;<p>“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Walker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.</p>&nbsp;<p>About five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.</p>&nbsp;<p>“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”</p>&nbsp;<p>What does Walker enjoy most about photography?</p>&nbsp;<p>“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Pugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Pugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”</p>&nbsp;<p>The subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.</p>&nbsp;<p>“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”</p>&nbsp;<p>So what’s real?</p>&nbsp;<p>“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.</p>&nbsp;<p>“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. </p>&nbsp;<p>“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.</p>&nbsp;<p>“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”</p>&nbsp;<p>As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.</p>&nbsp;<p>“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” </p>&nbsp;<p>Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. </p>&nbsp;<p>Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Lt.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…

Retired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…

Staff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…

…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.

There were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.

“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”

Winners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp;amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.

Walker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. 

The subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.

“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.

“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”

Walker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.

About five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.

“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”

What does Walker enjoy most about photography?

“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”

Pugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”

Pugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.

“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”

Piedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.

“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”

The subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.

“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”

So what’s real?

“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.

“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”

Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.

“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”

Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. 

“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.

“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”

As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.

“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”

Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” 

Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. 

Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”

Lt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”

Staff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.

<div class="description" title="NME (New Musical Express) published its list of the 500 all time greatest albums this week, based on its poll of roughly 80 critics who work for it. I saw a listing on the internet of the NME top 500 and it&#x27;s set out below.  The stars indicate the albums that would probably make my personal top 500 and the check marks indicate albums I&#x27;ve listened to that don&#x27;t make my personal top 500.   

This is in my sweet spot.  When a bunch of highly knowledgeable critics decide on the &amp;quot;best ever&#x27; I&#x27;m going to seek that music out. They&#x27;ve heard more music than I ever have (there are 188 records on the list that I&#x27;ve never listened to). 

Still, I have some quibbles about the list.  The Smiths at #1?  I&#x27;ve never understood the appeal of the Smiths. I went back and listened again to &amp;quot;The Queen Is Dead&amp;quot; and found it just as unbearable as ever.  Maybe it&#x27;s a British thing.

Second, no Robert Johnson or Hank Williams?  I&#x27;m betting this is because the list seems to ban compilation albums and Johnson and Williams recorded exclusively as singles artists.  But it just seems wrong to claim that the 500 best all time records don&#x27;t include Hank Williams or Robert Johnson.

Third, where are the great British folkies?  How can there be no Richard Thompson, no Fairport Convention, and no Pentangle? [Update: I see I&#x27;m wrong and that Fairport Convention is at #110.  Still, why no Richard Thompson?]

Fourth, the list seems to ignore most of the world (maybe there&#x27;s a rule saying English language only).  But you can&#x27;t have a list of the 500 best of all time with no Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and not a single album from Brazil. 

Fifth, where&#x27;s WIllie Nelson?

	<p><p>NME (New Musical Express) published its list of the 500 all time greatest albums this week, based on its poll of roughly 80 critics who work for it. I saw a listing on the internet of the NME top 500 and it's set out below.  The stars indicate the albums that would probably make my personal top 500 and the check marks indicate albums I've listened to that don't make my personal top 500.   </p>&nbsp;<p>This is in my sweet spot.  When a bunch of highly knowledgeable critics decide on the &quot;best ever' I'm going to seek that music out. They've heard more music than I ever have (there are 188 records on the list that I've never listened to). </p>&nbsp;<p>Still, I have some quibbles about the list.  The Smiths at <a href="/photos/tags/1%3F">#1?</a>  I've never understood the appeal of the Smiths. I went back and listened again to &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; and found it just as unbearable as ever.  Maybe it's a British thing.</p>&nbsp;<p>Second, no Robert Johnson or Hank Williams?  I'm betting this is because the list seems to ban compilation albums and Johnson and Williams recorded exclusively as singles artists.  But it just seems wrong to claim that the 500 best all time records don't include Hank Williams or Robert Johnson.</p>&nbsp;<p>Third, where are the great British folkies?  How can there be no Richard Thompson, no Fairport Convention, and no Pentangle? [Update: I see I'm wrong and that Fairport Convention is at <a href="/photos/tags/110.">#110.</a>  Still, why no Richard Thompson?]</p>&nbsp;<p>Fourth, the list seems to ignore most of the world (maybe there's a rule saying English language only).  But you can't have a list of the 500 best of all time with no Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and not a single album from Brazil. </p>&nbsp;<p>Fifth, where's WIllie Nelson?</p>&nbsp;<p>-----------------------------</p><p>★ - Would be on my personal Top 500</p><p>✓ - Have listened to album and would not be in my personal Top 500</p><p>? - Have listened to album and still undecided about it</p><p>~ - Have listened to album and it stinks</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>~1.

<div class="description" title="The grounds of the Grade I Listed Baddesley Clinton, a moated manor house, located just north of the Warwick in Warwickshire. The house was probably established during the 13th century when large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is run by the National Trust. 

In 1438, John Brome, Under-Treasurer of England, bought the manor, which passed to his son, Nicholas. Nicholas was responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby parish church dedicated to Saint Michael, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edward Ferrers (High Sheriff of Warwickshire) in 1500. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited it in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust, who now manage it.

Henry Ferrers &amp;quot;The Antiquary&amp;quot; (1549–1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family&#x27;s coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. It is thought that he was responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the east range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building.

The house was inhabited in the 1860s by the novelists Georgiana Chatterton and her second husband Edward Heneage Dering, both of whom converted to Catholicism. The house&#x27;s Catholic chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive formal gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael&#x27;s church, which shares much history with the house is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used.

&lt;b&gt;Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311&lt;/b&gt;

By Tim Hipps
FMWRC Public Affairs

ALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…

Retired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…

Staff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…

…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.

There were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.

“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”

Winners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp;amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.

Walker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. 

The subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.

“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.

“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”

Walker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.

About five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.

“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”

What does Walker enjoy most about photography?

“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”

Pugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”

Pugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.

“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”

Piedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.

“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”

The subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.

“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”

So what’s real?

“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.

“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”

Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.

“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”

Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. 

“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.

“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”

As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.

“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”

Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” 

Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. 

Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”

Lt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”

Staff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.

For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”</p>&nbsp;<p>So what’s real?</p>&nbsp;<p>“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.</p>&nbsp;<p>“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. </p>&nbsp;<p>“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.</p>&nbsp;<p>“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”</p>&nbsp;<p>As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.</p>&nbsp;<p>“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” </p>&nbsp;<p>Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. </p>&nbsp;<p>Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Lt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Staff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.</p>&nbsp;<p>SIDEBAR:</p>&nbsp;<p>Here are the results of the top three finishers in each category with photographer’s rank, name, installation and photo title:</p>&nbsp;<p>2010 Army Digital Photo Contest</p><p>Division I </p>&nbsp;<p>Animals – 1.

<div class="description" title="Tim Walker 
The Garden of Earthly Delights

In January 2015, Nicola Erni commissioned British fashion photographer Tim Walker to create a series of photographs of his own choice. Exactly a year later, Factum Arte was approached by Walker and Erni through an introduction by Michael Hoppen (founder &amp;amp; director of the Michael Hoppen Gallery, London), to produce a series of 27 vast digital prints of images taken by the photographer.

Tim Walker, best known for working for many years as a commercial photographer for British, American and Italian Vogue, has exhibited his works at solo exhibitions for a number of years, in spaces such as Somerset House (2012), the Design Museum (2008) and the Bowes museum (2013). He also received numerous awards during the length of his career, including the Infinity Award for the International Center for Photography, and an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society.

Walker´s obsession with 15th century Netherlandish Master, Hieronymus Bosch, led him to create his own take on his famous paiting the Garden of Earthly Delights. Together with set designer, Shona Heath, the photographer recreated the key elements from a Boschian world. The shoot, which took place over five days at Eglingham Hall in Northumberland, produced a series of sensational, symbolic and highly sensory photographs, filled with exquisitely sensual characters and objects, and deeply striking mise-en-scène.

The prints, which can now be found at Nicola Erni´s private collection in Zug, Switzerland, were materialised by Factum Arte, and are a result of several material and technological innovations which have been taking place within the Factum Arte studios over several years.

Tim Walker´s work will be on view at the Noordbrabants Museum in the Netherlands as part of the exhibition: Tim Walker: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Bosch through the eyes of a fashion photographer (November 4 - February 25, 2018)

ABOUT FRANK GEHRY’S AGO DESIGN:

The new AGO is Toronto-born Frank Gehry’s first building in Canada and marks the very place where he made the initial connection between art and architecture. Hallmarks of his AGO design connect the city and the Gallery in provocative new ways including dramatic sculptural staircases, the warmth of Douglas fir, and the extensive use of glass which infuses the galleries with natural light.

From the outside of the gallery the most striking addition is the long glass façade that covers the Galleria Italia on the north side of the building. Below the glass wall, the gallery’s main entrance has been re-aligned with the center of the building. At the gallery’s south end, Gehry added the largest addition to the gallery through a new wing. This south wing is clad with blue-tinted titanium and house the gallery’s contemporary galleries. This wing is also pierced by two cantilevered serpent-like staircases on both sides.
    
Upon entering, visitors will see that Gehry has grouped the gallery’s bookstore, restaurant, theatre and café to the east. This commercial hub also includes the AGO’s free contemporary gallery. The atrium is linked to the gallery by a set of stairs and a winding ramp that snakes around an opening to the galleries below. directly ahead, Gehry has restored the historic walker court. However, the new walker court is anchored by a wood paneled serpent-like staircase, which breaks through the glass ceiling and joins the exterior stairs on the south wing’s north face.
    
Inside the galleries, Gehry has exercised more subtlety giving many of the old European galleries and Henry Moore wing only minor upgrades to tie them into the overall scheme. However there are many spaces where Gehry had room to play. The new gallery spaces like the glass façade Galleria Italia and south wing galleries demonstrate this freedom. Gehry also designed a series of seating for the gallery, producing chaise lounges he named ‘Adam’ and ‘Eve’.
    
Despite the seemingly disconnected nature of Gehry’s additions, the gallery is now fully unified with a harmonious flow. Overall, the new transformation added 97,000 square feet of space, increasing the available gallery space by 50%. As such, the gallery remains one of North America’s largest museums, now boasting a total of 583,000 square feet of space.

South Wing
While the Galleria Italia may be the most iconic section of the new addition, the south wing is its most expansive. The wing features four stories that overlook Grange Park to the south. The main level features a glass enclosed sculpture atrium which is link between Walker Court and the Grange building’s member’s lounge. Above the atrium is the first of three levels that are clad in the blue-tinted titanium and glass curtain. The large glass windows on each level have again been humanized with a series of horizontal wooden louvers. On the top floor, large skylights funnel light into the galleries. These upper floors are connected by a 1.5m spiral staircase that features windows on all sides. Inside the galleries, Gehry conceived of a space arrangement that features many small intimate galleries within the larger space. 
    
Galleria Italia
The new Galleria Italia  is located on the second floor at the north end of the AGO. The gallery was named after the 26 Toronto families of Italian descent who each contributed 500,000 CAD to the AGO building project. This gallery stretches the entire length of the AGO with its long glass façade anchored to a ribbed wooden structure. The façade measures 137m and overhangs the sidewalk below. The glass curves toward the building at the top, resembling an overturned canoe. the angle of the glass reflects the old Victorian row houses across the street from the gallery, juxtaposing the old and new. At each end of the glass span, sections appear to be peeling away from the structure, like sails caught in the wind. 
    
Inside the glass façade, a sculpture gallery is bathed in natural light. stretching the entire gallery are massive wooden beams made from Douglas Fir that resemble a ribcage. This extensive use of wood gives the gallery a natural warmth that humanizes the space. The glass wall also allows visitors to peer out into the street, highlighting the muted flurry of activity below.

Walker Court
Thanks to the relocated entrance, the Walker Court, the historic heart of the AGO, now lies at the centre of the building. Gehry has restored the court to its original splendor, adding a glass ceiling that floods the space with light. The court looks out toward the street level entrance to the north and the original Grange building to the south, which now serves as the member’s lounge. Wooden walkways surround the court and let visitors peer down as the walk between galleries one floor above.
    
At the far end of the court, Gehry has added a spiraling staircase that is enclosed on all sides. The Douglas Fir clad stairs spiral straight out of walker court, breaking through the glass ceiling. Once outside they morph into the metal staircase that is connected to the contemporary galleries in the south wing.

ABOUT FRANK GEHRY:

“The Art Gallery of Ontario is where I first experienced art as a child and it was Grange Park where I played, so this project means a great deal to me. The building we envision will connect the city and its people to great art and art experiences.” Frank Gehry, Architect

Born and raised in Toronto, Canada, Frank Gehry moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1947. Gehry received his Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954, and he studied City Planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.

In subsequent years, Gehry has built an architectural career that has spanned four decades and produced public and private buildings in America, Europe and Asia. In an article published in the New York Times in November 1989, noted architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote that Gehry&#x27;s “buildings are powerful essays in primal geometric form and ... materials, and from an aesthetic standpoint they are among the most profound and brilliant works of architecture of our time.”

His work has earned Gehry several of the most significant awards in the architectural field. In 1977, Gehry was named recipient of the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize in Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1989, he was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize – perhaps the premiere accolade of the field – honoring “significant contributions to humanity and the built environment through the art of architecture.” In 1992, he received the Wolf Prize in Art (Architecture) from the Wolf Foundation. In the same year, he was named the recipient of the Praemium Imperiale Award by the Japan Art Association to “honor outstanding contributions to the development, popularization and progress of the arts.”

In 1994, Gehry became the first recipient of the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Award for lifetime contribution to the arts. In 1998, he received the National Medal of Arts, and he became the first recipient of the Friedrich Kiesler Prize. In 1999, Gehry received the Lotos Medal of Merit from the Lotos Club, and he received the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects. In 2000, he received the Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from Americans for the Arts.

In 2002, Gehry received the Gold Medal for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Gehry was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1987, a trustee of the American Academy in Rome in 1989, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991. In 1994, he was bestowed with the title of Academician by the National Academy of Design. In 1998, he was named an Honourary Academician by the Royal Academy of Arts.

In 2003, Gehry was inducted into the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and he was designated as a Companion to the Order of Canada. Gehry has received honorary doctoral degrees from Occidental College, Whittier College, the California College of Arts and Crafts, the Technical University of Nova Scotia, the Rhode Island School of Design, the California Institute of Arts, the Southern California Institute of Architecture, the Otis Art Institute at the Parsons School of Design, the University of Toronto, the University of Southern California, Yale University, Harvard University, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1982, 1985, and 1987-89, Gehry held the Charlotte Davenport Professorship in Architectureat Yale University. In 1984, he held the Eliot Noyes Chair at Harvard University. In 1996-97, he was a visiting scholar at the Federal Institute of Technologyin Zürich, Switzerland. Gehry was elected to the College of Fellows ofthe American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.) in 1974, and his buildings have received over 100 national and regional A.I.A. awards. 

Gehry&#x27;s work has been featured in major architectural publications and in national and international trade journals. Gehry&#x27;s architectural drawings and models have been exhibited in major museums throughout the world.

The Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) is an art museum in Toronto&#x27;s downtown Grange Park district. With 583,000 square feet of physical space, the AGO is the 10th largest art museum in North America.

The museum was founded in 1900 by a group of private citizens, who incorporated the institution as the Art Museum of Toronto. The museum was renamed the Art Gallery of Toronto in 1919, and subsequently the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1966.

The current location of the AGO dates to 1910, when the gallery was willed the estate known as the Grange, a historic Georgian manor built in 1817, upon the death of Goldwin Smith. In 1911, the museum leased lands to the south of the manor to the City of Toronto in perpetuity so as to create Grange Park. In 1920, the museum also allowed the Ontario College of Art to construct a building on the grounds.

The museum&#x27;s first formal exhibitions were opened in the Grange in 1913. In 1916, the museum decided to begin construction of a small portion of a planned new gallery building. Designed by Pearson and Darling in the Beaux-Arts style, the first galleries opened in 1918. Expansion throughout the 20th century added various galleries, culminating in 1993, which left the AGO with 413,000 sq ft of interior space.

The AGO expanded its facility in 2008 with an innovative architectural design by world-renowned architect Frank Gehry. Although Gehry was born in Toronto, and as a child had lived in the same neighborhood as the AGO, the expansion of the gallery represented his first work in Canada. Gehry was commissioned to expand and revitalize the AGO, not to design a new building; as such, one of the challenges he faced was to unite the disparate areas of the building that had become a bit of a &amp;quot;hodgepodge&amp;quot; after six previous expansions dating back to the 1920s.

ABOUT THE AGO COLLECTION:

The AGO holds more than 79,000 works in its collection, which spans from 100 A.D. to the present. Highlights include:

	<p><p>South Wing of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 317 Dundas Street West, Toronto, Canada</p>&nbsp;<p>by navema</p><p><a href="http://www.navemastudios.com" rel="nofollow">www.navemastudios.com</a></p>&nbsp;<p>ABOUT FRANK GEHRY’S AGO DESIGN:</p>&nbsp;<p>The new AGO is Toronto-born Frank Gehry’s first building in Canada and marks the very place where he made the initial connection between art and architecture. Hallmarks of his AGO design connect the city and the Gallery in provocative new ways including dramatic sculptural staircases, the warmth of Douglas fir, and the extensive use of glass which infuses the galleries with natural light.</p>&nbsp;<p>From the outside of the gallery the most striking addition is the long glass façade that covers the Galleria Italia on the north side of the building. Below the glass wall, the gallery’s main entrance has been re-aligned with the center of the building. At the gallery’s south end, Gehry added the largest addition to the gallery through a new wing. This south wing is clad with blue-tinted titanium and house the gallery’s contemporary galleries. This wing is also pierced by two cantilevered serpent-like staircases on both sides.</p>&nbsp;<p>Upon entering, visitors will see that Gehry has grouped the gallery’s bookstore, restaurant, theatre and café to the east. This commercial hub also includes the AGO’s free contemporary gallery. The atrium is linked to the gallery by a set of stairs and a winding ramp that snakes around an opening to the galleries below. directly ahead, Gehry has restored the historic walker court. However, the new walker court is anchored by a wood paneled serpent-like staircase, which breaks through the glass ceiling and joins the exterior stairs on the south wing’s north face.</p>&nbsp;<p>Inside the galleries, Gehry has exercised more subtlety giving many of the old European galleries and Henry Moore wing only minor upgrades to tie them into the overall scheme. However there are many spaces where Gehry had room to play. The new gallery spaces like the glass façade Galleria Italia and south wing galleries demonstrate this freedom. Gehry also designed a series of seating for the gallery, producing chaise lounges he named ‘Adam’ and ‘Eve’.</p>&nbsp;<p>Despite the seemingly disconnected nature of Gehry’s additions, the gallery is now fully unified with a harmonious flow. Overall, the new transformation added 97,000 square feet of space, increasing the available gallery space by 50%. As such, the gallery remains one of North America’s largest museums, now boasting a total of 583,000 square feet of space.</p>&nbsp;<p>South Wing</p><p>While the Galleria Italia may be the most iconic section of the new addition, the south wing is its most expansive. The wing features four stories that overlook Grange Park to the south. The main level features a glass enclosed sculpture atrium which is link between Walker Court and the Grange building’s member’s lounge. Above the atrium is the first of three levels that are clad in the blue-tinted titanium and glass curtain. The large glass windows on each level have again been humanized with a series of horizontal wooden louvers. On the top floor, large skylights funnel light into the galleries. These upper floors are connected by a 1.5m spiral staircase that features windows on all sides. Inside the galleries, Gehry conceived of a space arrangement that features many small intimate galleries within the larger space. </p>&nbsp;<p>Galleria Italia</p><p>The new Galleria Italia  is located on the second floor at the north end of the AGO. The gallery was named after the 26 Toronto families of Italian descent who each contributed 500,000 CAD to the AGO building project. This gallery stretches the entire length of the AGO with its long glass façade anchored to a ribbed wooden structure. The façade measures 137m and overhangs the sidewalk below. The glass curves toward the building at the top, resembling an overturned canoe. the angle of the glass reflects the old Victorian row houses across the street from the gallery, juxtaposing the old and new. At each end of the glass span, sections appear to be peeling away from the structure, like sails caught in the wind. </p>&nbsp;<p>Inside the glass façade, a sculpture gallery is bathed in natural light. stretching the entire gallery are massive wooden beams made from Douglas Fir that resemble a ribcage. This extensive use of wood gives the gallery a natural warmth that humanizes the space. The glass wall also allows visitors to peer out into the street, highlighting the muted flurry of activity below.</p>&nbsp;<p>Walker Court</p><p>Thanks to the relocated entrance, the Walker Court, the historic heart of the AGO, now lies at the centre of the building. Gehry has restored the court to its original splendor, adding a glass ceiling that floods the space with light. The court looks out toward the street level entrance to the north and the original Grange building to the south, which now serves as the member’s lounge. Wooden walkways surround the court and let visitors peer down as the walk between galleries one floor above.</p>&nbsp;<p>At the far end of the court, Gehry has added a spiraling staircase that is enclosed on all sides. The Douglas Fir clad stairs spiral straight out of walker court, breaking through the glass ceiling. Once outside they morph into the metal staircase that is connected to the contemporary galleries in the south wing.</p>&nbsp;<p>ABOUT FRANK GEHRY:</p>&nbsp;<p>“The Art Gallery of Ontario is where I first experienced art as a child and it was Grange Park where I played, so this project means a great deal to me. The building we envision will connect the city and its people to great art and art experiences.” Frank Gehry, Architect</p>&nbsp;<p>Born and raised in Toronto, Canada, Frank Gehry moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1947. Gehry received his Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954, and he studied City Planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.</p>&nbsp;<p>In subsequent years, Gehry has built an architectural career that has spanned four decades and produced public and private buildings in America, Europe and Asia. In an article published in the New York Times in November 1989, noted architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote that Gehry's “buildings are powerful essays in primal geometric form and ... materials, and from an aesthetic standpoint they are among the most profound and brilliant works of architecture of our time.”</p>&nbsp;<p>His work has earned Gehry several of the most significant awards in the architectural field. In 1977, Gehry was named recipient of the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize in Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1989, he was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize – perhaps the premiere accolade of the field – honoring “significant contributions to humanity and the built environment through the art of architecture.” In 1992, he received the Wolf Prize in Art (Architecture) from the Wolf Foundation. In the same year, he was named the recipient of the Praemium Imperiale Award by the Japan Art Association to “honor outstanding contributions to the development, popularization and progress of the arts.”</p>&nbsp;<p>In 1994, Gehry became the first recipient of the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Award for lifetime contribution to the arts. In 1998, he received the National Medal of Arts, and he became the first recipient of the Friedrich Kiesler Prize. In 1999, Gehry received the Lotos Medal of Merit from the Lotos Club, and he received the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects. In 2000, he received the Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from Americans for the Arts.</p>&nbsp;<p>In 2002, Gehry received the Gold Medal for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Gehry was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1987, a trustee of the American Academy in Rome in 1989, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991. In 1994, he was bestowed with the title of Academician by the National Academy of Design. In 1998, he was named an Honourary Academician by the Royal Academy of Arts.</p>&nbsp;<p>In 2003, Gehry was inducted into the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and he was designated as a Companion to the Order of Canada. Gehry has received honorary doctoral degrees from Occidental College, Whittier College, the California College of Arts and Crafts, the Technical University of Nova Scotia, the Rhode Island School of Design, the California Institute of Arts, the Southern California Institute of Architecture, the Otis Art Institute at the Parsons School of Design, the University of Toronto, the University of Southern California, Yale University, Harvard University, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1982, 1985, and 1987-89, Gehry held the Charlotte Davenport Professorship in Architectureat Yale University. In 1984, he held the Eliot Noyes Chair at Harvard University. In 1996-97, he was a visiting scholar at the Federal Institute of Technologyin Zürich, Switzerland. Gehry was elected to the College of Fellows ofthe American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.) in 1974, and his buildings have received over 100 national and regional A.I.A. awards. </p>&nbsp;<p>Gehry's work has been featured in major architectural publications and in national and international trade journals. Gehry's architectural drawings and models have been exhibited in major museums throughout the world.</p>&nbsp;<p>For his website, visit: <a href="http://www.foga.com/" rel="nofollow">www.foga.com/</a></p>&nbsp;<p>ABOUT THE AGO:</p>&nbsp;<p>The Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) is an art museum in Toronto's downtown Grange Park district.

<div class="description" title="The Grade I Listed Baddesley Clinton, a moated manor house, located just north of the Warwick in Warwickshire. The house was probably established during the 13th century when large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is run by the National Trust. 

In 1438, John Brome, Under-Treasurer of England, bought the manor, which passed to his son, Nicholas. Nicholas was responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby parish church dedicated to Saint Michael, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edward Ferrers (High Sheriff of Warwickshire) in 1500. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited it in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust, who now manage it.

Henry Ferrers &amp;quot;The Antiquary&amp;quot; (1549–1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family&#x27;s coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. It is thought that he was responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the east range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building.

The house was inhabited in the 1860s by the novelists Georgiana Chatterton and her second husband Edward Heneage Dering, both of whom converted to Catholicism. The house&#x27;s Catholic chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive formal gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael&#x27;s church, which shares much history with the house is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used.

<div class="description" title="The Grade I Listed Baddesley Clinton, a moated manor house, located just north of the Warwick in Warwickshire. The house was probably established during the 13th century when large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is run by the National Trust. 

In 1438, John Brome, Under-Treasurer of England, bought the manor, which passed to his son, Nicholas. Nicholas was responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby parish church dedicated to Saint Michael, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edward Ferrers (High Sheriff of Warwickshire) in 1500. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited it in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust, who now manage it.

Henry Ferrers &amp;quot;The Antiquary&amp;quot; (1549–1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family&#x27;s coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. It is thought that he was responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the east range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building.

The house was inhabited in the 1860s by the novelists Georgiana Chatterton and her second husband Edward Heneage Dering, both of whom converted to Catholicism. The house&#x27;s Catholic chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive formal gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael&#x27;s church, which shares much history with the house is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used.

&#x27;What do all these buttons do again?!&#x27;

So went my text message to &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/keifereef/&quot;&gt;Keith Aggett&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, suddenly finding myself alone in a wet and muddy field, camera in hand and innapropriate flip-flops (foolish given yesterday&#x27;s downpour) adorning my feet.  A combination of incessant rainfall with no respect for the season, home decorating, family commitments, long hours at work (I manage a team doing twelve hour shifts and it&#x27;s surprising how often twelve can become sixteen), and my own general dislike for summer imagery had left me precious little time to get out and take any photographs.  In fact, it&#x27;s fair to say I was feeling slightly disconnected - not good for any photographer - although I was pleased to note it didn&#x27;t take long before my camera began to feel reassuringly familiar in my grasp, apparently forgiving me for it&#x27;s period of impromptu hibernation.

My phone rang in response.  Answering it, Keith&#x27;s query of &amp;quot;You&#x27;re out shooting then mate?&amp;quot; was met with a spluttering cough before I could reply properly.  Oh, didn&#x27;t I mention above the cold I&#x27;m recovering from?  No?  Oh well, never mind...  Keith&#x27;s revelation that there was some excellent racing cloud (LE practitioners will understand) where he currently was in Exeter - some twenty miles from me - didn&#x27;t do a great deal to inspire, although several minutes into our conversation and I suddenly cut him off with the news that the singularly ominous, dramatic bank of cloud I&#x27;d been waiting to head nearer was gaining position...

&#x27;That cloud is full of rain.  I&#x27;m now wet.&#x27;

That was exactly how my next text message read.  Determined to embrace the stalwart British tradition of perseverance, I ignored my sodden shirt and the rain dripping from my nose (at least I think it was rain - damn that cold), keen on removing the lens cap now that the shower had moved on.  Quickly assembling my ND filter lens housing, eager to capture something of the remaining brooding sky without the threat of droplets ruining the shot, I turned briefly to see an enormous dog bounding towards me.  I mean enormous.  Had I meant big, or slightly larger than average I would have said so.  This dog was clearly related to The Hound Of The Baskervilles, and looking beyond it I could see it had two similarly apportioned siblings - both of which seemed unsure whether to rush me or bide their ground in case the first one failed to take me out alone, a feat that seemed highly likely at that point.  I barely had time to register it&#x27;s unseen owner&#x27;s shout of beckoning as the animal skidded to a halt, it&#x27;s intended leap limited to just two dirty pawprints on my jeans.  I didn&#x27;t care - I was alive!  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like dogs - far from it in fact, I had my own for a good ten years and intend to get another eventually.  It&#x27;s just that in my experience, most dog owner&#x27;s I encounter when I&#x27;m out taking shot&#x27;s seem to assume that everyone else loves their pet too.  The number of times I&#x27;ve had to loft my backpack high to stop some beast urinating on it, or shout at one myself as an insidious hind leg begins to cock itself against my tripod - while simultaneously the owner remains conveniently oblivious.  Perhaps next time I&#x27;ll run after the person concerned, jumping up at them and popping a flash unit in their face manically!  At least on this occasion the owner did make some half-mumbled words of apology as he trudged by with his trotting trio of Satan, Lucifer and Beelzebub...  Looking down I realised I&#x27;d been stood all the time just inches away from a pile of what I shall politely describe as canine excrement, judging by the size of which I (perhaps unfairly) attributed to my new four-legged friend.

Deciding it was time to try a different subject from the telegraph poles it had been my intent to capture (I haven&#x27;t yet reviewed the images but feel I will be lucky if I nailed the shot), I went on to a second nearby site where I&#x27;ve tried several times to shoot a particular item.  Minutes after I got out of the car it started to rain again, leading me to take shelter beneath some overhanging trees at the side of a path, crouching down to gain better cover and trying not to let my resolve weaken.  A second dog walker passed me by, eyeing me suspiciously in my lair as I raised a hand in the universal symbol of &#x27;I&#x27;m ok, really I am.&#x27;  Several email checks later, a quick game of Angry Birds and a catch up on my flickr contact&#x27;s recent uploads and the rain suddenly cleared.  Hurrying on to my destination, I was confronted by the newly revealed sun placed directly behind my subject - creating huge contrasts and glare.  I did actually set up my gear, frame everything up, focus and get my filters and cable release ready hoping for a fresh bout of obscuring cloud but it wasn&#x27;t to be.  That didn&#x27;t happen until half an hour or so later when I was back in my car heading for home...

Nobody said landscape photography was easy!  It isn&#x27;t, but all of you I&#x27;m sure have had occasions like these - and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree the good times are all the more sweet because of them.  Yin and yang in all things.  

Consequently, this shot is one from my archives taken almost a year ago on a day when things went my way a little more easily...

On a separate note, I&#x27;m happy to announce my &#x27;Snake&#x27; image (elsewhere on my photostream) was a Nominee in the Fine Art category of the recent international Black &amp;amp; White Spider Awards - &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;http://www.thespiderawards.com/&quot; rel&#x3D;&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.thespiderawards.com/&lt;/a&gt;.

The Garden of Earthly Delights

In January 2015, Nicola Erni commissioned British fashion photographer Tim Walker to create a series of photographs of his own choice. Exactly a year later, Factum Arte was approached by Walker and Erni through an introduction by Michael Hoppen (founder &amp;amp; director of the Michael Hoppen Gallery, London), to produce a series of 27 vast digital prints of images taken by the photographer.

Tim Walker, best known for working for many years as a commercial photographer for British, American and Italian Vogue, has exhibited his works at solo exhibitions for a number of years, in spaces such as Somerset House (2012), the Design Museum (2008) and the Bowes museum (2013). He also received numerous awards during the length of his career, including the Infinity Award for the International Center for Photography, and an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society.

Walker´s obsession with 15th century Netherlandish Master, Hieronymus Bosch, led him to create his own take on his famous paiting the Garden of Earthly Delights. Together with set designer, Shona Heath, the photographer recreated the key elements from a Boschian world. The shoot, which took place over five days at Eglingham Hall in Northumberland, produced a series of sensational, symbolic and highly sensory photographs, filled with exquisitely sensual characters and objects, and deeply striking mise-en-scène.

The prints, which can now be found at Nicola Erni´s private collection in Zug, Switzerland, were materialised by Factum Arte, and are a result of several material and technological innovations which have been taking place within the Factum Arte studios over several years.

Tim Walker´s work will be on view at the Noordbrabants Museum in the Netherlands as part of the exhibition: Tim Walker: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Bosch through the eyes of a fashion photographer (November 4 - February 25, 2018)

&lt;b&gt;Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311&lt;/b&gt;

By Tim Hipps
FMWRC Public Affairs

ALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…

Retired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…

Staff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…

…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.

There were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.

“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”

Winners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp;amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.

Walker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. 

The subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.

“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.

“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”

Walker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.

About five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.

“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”

What does Walker enjoy most about photography?

“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”

Pugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”

Pugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.

“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”

Piedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.

“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”

The subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.

“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”

So what’s real?

“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.

“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”

Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.

“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”

Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. 

“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.

“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”

As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.

“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”

Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” 

Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. 

Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”

Lt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”

Staff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.

It’s another form of art.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Pugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Pugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”</p>&nbsp;<p>The subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.</p>&nbsp;<p>“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”</p>&nbsp;<p>So what’s real?</p>&nbsp;<p>“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.</p>&nbsp;<p>“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. </p>&nbsp;<p>“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.</p>&nbsp;<p>“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”</p>&nbsp;<p>As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.</p>&nbsp;<p>“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” </p>&nbsp;<p>Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. </p>&nbsp;<p>Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Lt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Staff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>SIDEBAR:</p>&nbsp;<p>Here are the results of the top three finishers in each category with photographer’s rank, name, installation and photo title:</p>&nbsp;<p>2010 Army Digital Photo Contest</p><p>Division I </p>&nbsp;<p>Animals – 1.

<div class="description" title="The Saltee Islands, consisting of the Great and Little Saltee, St. Georges Channel are situated approximately 5 kilometres off the coast of Kilmore Quay Co.Wexford. The larger island Great Saltee is the most famous bird sanctuary in Ireland and is very popular with both day-trippers and birdwatchers. These Islands are privately owned and are one of the world&#x27;s major bird sanctuaries.

The Saltees are a haven for sea birds, nurturing an impressive array of birds, from Gannets and Gulls to Puffins and Manx Shearwaters. They also lie on an important migratory route and a popular stopping-off place for spring and autumn migrants. The Great Saltee also has a breeding population of Grey Seals, one of the very few in eastern Ireland. Up to 120 animals are present in autumn and up to 20 pups are produced annually. 

These Islands are among the ancient islands of Europe, based on Pre-Cambrian bedrock i.e. between 600 and 2000 million years old. There is archaeological evidence that Neolithic man settled there, and traces of religious settlements exist. There is also evidence of buccaneering and smuggling. A flourishing period in the history of the islands was from about 1500 - 1800 when they were a base for pirates, wreckers and smugglers. The gains of the wreckers and smugglers could very well be hidden in the many caves which have mysterious and romantic names - Lady Walker&#x27;s Cave, Happy Hole, Otter&#x27;s Cave and Hell Hole, enough for any Treasure Island. These and other caves can be clearly seen on The Great Saltee Map (Information Page).

The waters around the islands can be treacherous, hence the area is know as the &amp;quot;Graveyard of a Thousand Ships&amp;quot; and the islands their tombstones.

One of the most spectacular sights on the Saltees in mid-Summer are the sea birds colonies on the cliffs to the north-east of the Gannet headland. Vast numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills pack the ledges and create a frightful incessant din which only at night abates a little. The Fulmars too play their part in this splendour. Towards dusk the sight of the Puffins congregating in small groups near their nestling sites presents a marvellous sight. 

If the Saltees had any other name before their present title, it has been long lost. As for the origin of the name there are two possible theories, Norse or of Old or Middle English derivation. However the name suggests a Norse origin (Salt ey - salt island) derived from the phenomenon of the salty spray which sweeps across the islands at times of high winds and waves, especially during the winter. 

Since December 1943 the Saltees are privately owned by the Neale family. Prince Michael the First died in January 1998 and is buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay, Co.Wexford. He has been succeeded by his eldest son Michael the Second. 

Permission for day visits to the Great Saltee, by courtesy of the Neale family, is not needed. Permission to visit the Little Saltee can not be granted due to the hazardous landing conditions.  However we would like all visitors to respect these islands and in the words of the late Prince Michael the First.

 

 

&amp;quot;All people, young and old, are welcome to come, see and enjoy the Islands, and
 leave them as they found them for the unborn generations to come, see and enjoy.&amp;quot;

                                                                                                           Michael the First
 

 

 

These sentiments expressed and carved in stone welcomes all visitors to these islands, erected above the landing steps on the Great Saltee.">

The Garden of Earthly Delights

In January 2015, Nicola Erni commissioned British fashion photographer Tim Walker to create a series of photographs of his own choice. Exactly a year later, Factum Arte was approached by Walker and Erni through an introduction by Michael Hoppen (founder &amp;amp; director of the Michael Hoppen Gallery, London), to produce a series of 27 vast digital prints of images taken by the photographer.

Tim Walker´s work will be on view at the Noordbrabants Museum in the Netherlands as part of the exhibition: Tim Walker: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Bosch through the eyes of a fashion photographer (November 4 - February 25, 2018)

Haslingden is a town in Rossendale, Lancashire, England. It is 19 miles (31 km) north of Manchester. The name means &#x27;valley of the hazels&#x27;. In the early 20th century Haslingden had the status of a municipal borough, but following local government reorganisation in 1974 it became part of the Borough of Rossendale. At the time of the 2001 census the town had a population of 16,849.
Haslingden is the birthplace of the composer Alan Rawsthorne (1905–1971) and the Manchester City and England footballer Colin Bell (b.1946), was the home for many years of the Irish Republican leader, Michael Davitt (1846–1906), and Haslingden Cricket Club is a member of the noteworthy Lancashire League.

Part of what is now Haslingden, along with that of the neighbouring towns of Rawtenstall and beyond that Bacup were part of the Forest of Blackburnshire, that part being the Forest of Rossendale. The Forest was a hunting park during the late 13th and 14th centuries; &#x27;Forest&#x27; referred to it being parkland rather than being heavily wooded, as the forest declined much earlier, during the Neolithic period.
Haslingden grew from a market town (a market was established in 1676) and later a coaching station to a significant industrial borough during the period of the Industrial Revolution. In particular with the mechanisation of the wool and cotton spinning and weaving industries from the 18th to the 19th centuries, and with the development of watermills, and later steam power.
Haslingden was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1891. In the 20th century the population declined from 19,000 in the 1911 census to 15,000 in the 1971 census. The 2001 census recorded a population of 16,849 living in the town.

Haslingden is notable for its stone quarrying, and Haslingden Flag (a quartz-based sandstone) was exported throughout the country in the 19th century with the opening up of the rail network. It was used in the paving of London, including Trafalgar Square.
Flagstone is a type of sedimentary rock, relatively easy to split or quarry in slabs, and hence ideal for paving. Locally it is also used for making fences and roofing. There are Upper and Lower Haslingden Flagstones and the name is given to layers of the stone that appear throughout the area (not only in Haslingden) although the most spectacular examples are in the Rossendale valley.
In more recent times, Camfil Farr have become the biggest employer in the town. From humble beginnings in 1971 as Automet filtration the air filtration manufacturer has grown organically and by acquisition by Camfil Farr group in 1997. Today Camfil Farr occupy a large site on Knowsley Road and employ in excess of 200 people.


Landmarks


Churches

Haslingden&#x27;s Anglican parish church, St. James&#x27;, was built in the 18th century on a site occupied by a church building since at least 1284. In that year a deed of gift of the Earl of Lincoln to the monks of Stanlaw granted them the parish of Whalley. The church is considered to be the highest parish church above sea level in England.[citation needed] When they later took possession and had a valuation of its assets done, they recorded at Haslingden one of the parish&#x27;s seven independent chapelries. Beside the Memorial Gardens, the Manchester Road Methodist Church is a classic building with an Italian-inspired interior.


The Public Hall

The Public Hall was opened in 1868 and built by a private company formed by &#x27;gentlemen representing the working classes and temperance movement&#x27;. It was bought by the town council in 1898 but is now largely unused. Used for 50 or more years by Rossendale Amateur Operatic Society, and other local groups, the hall was closed by Rossendale Council in 2005 after an audit commission found them to be the worst council in the country and this was shown in the published league tables of the time.[citation needed] The hall has since been sold by the council to a group representing the Asian heritage community and is in the process of being turned into a mosque (2009/ 2010). The public hall was once a venue of Winston Churchill during his early political career. Emmeline Pankhurst once addressed the people of Haslingden from the stage and, after the Battle of the Somme in 1916, it was a temporary hospital for the survivors of the Accrington Pals who were sent home for treatment.

Schools

The Wesleyan School formerly on the site of the current health centre was the first site in the world to introduce standardised intelligence tests for five to six year olds.[1] Haslingden High School is a specialist arts,maths and computing college. Haslingden Primary School was last inspected by Ofsted on 4 November 2010 and received a grading of &#x27;Good&#x27; with &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; features.

The library

Originally Haslingden Mechanics&#x27; Institute and opened in 1860, it became the public library in 1905. A blue plaque commemorates Michael Davitt. The young Davitt migrated to Haslingden with his family to escape the effects of the 1840s Irish Potato Famine. He began working in a cotton mill but at the age of 11 his right arm was entangled in a cogwheel and mangled so bad it had to be amputated. When he recovered from his operation a local benefactor, John Dean, helped to give him an education. He also started night classes at the Mechanics&#x27; Institute and used its library. Michael Davitt&#x27;s family home from 1867-1870 on Wilkinson Street is now marked by a memorial plaque.

Railway

Haslingden was once connected to Accrington and Bury by railway (Rush, 1983). The East Lancashire Railway built a station here, which remained open under British Railways until the 1960s, when the line was closed due to the Beeching Report (Wells and Bentley, 2000). Much of the trackbed of the railway is no longer visible, with the A56 by-pass built over it between Grane Road and Blackburn Road, however, the line can still be traced through Helmshore towards Stubbins where several magnificent viaducts still remain. The East Lancashire Railway Preservation Society was originally established at Helmshore Station in the mid 1960s with the aim of reopening the railway line to Stubbins, the project was abandoned with the organisation relocating to Bury in the 1970s and eventually reopening the Rawtenstall to Bury line.

Other notable places

The town centre is home to the famous Big Lamp originally erected in 1841 and from where all distances in Haslingden are measured, although the original lamp has been replaced by a replica, the original being lost after being taken to America. Cissy Green&#x27;s Bakery can be found on Deardengate. People visit from across Lancashire to sample the handmade pies which are still made to the original 1920s recipe. Allpine Beds Centre, the largest bed retailer in lancashire, stockists of Burgess beds, the oldest bed makers in Britain are found on Warner Street. To the north of the town is the Holland&#x27;s Pies factory, and Winfield&#x27;s, a large warehouse-style retail development selling footwear and clothing, and promoting itself as a family day out. Haslingden&#x27;s War Memorial is unusual in that it has no names recorded on it. To the northeast there is a 2 kW digital television transmitter serving a wide area.

Beauty spots

There is an extensive area of moorland to the east of Haslingden. These moors are divided into Oswaldtwistle Moor and Haslingden Moor. The area forms part of the West Pennine Moors. Plans were made in 2007 to build a wind farm consisting of twelve wind turbines on the moors. This attracted both support and opposition, but the plan was approved by councillors in 2010.[3] Further developments have yet to take place, and the plan remains controversial.
The nearby Snighole (eel-hole) in Helmshore is a well-known beauty spot. The Grane Valley including three reservoirs to the west of the town is popular with walkers.
Victoria Park has a bowling green, children&#x27;s playground, skateboard park and ball court. The top of the park affords views of Musbury Hill.

The Halo

The Halo is a Panopticon artwork which opened in 2007 and is sited in the hills above Haslingen as the centrepiece of a reclaimed landscape. It glows at night and is an unusual landmark, with an impressive viewpoint.

<div class="description" title="Tim Walker 
The Garden of Earthly Delights

In January 2015, Nicola Erni commissioned British fashion photographer Tim Walker to create a series of photographs of his own choice. Exactly a year later, Factum Arte was approached by Walker and Erni through an introduction by Michael Hoppen (founder &amp;amp; director of the Michael Hoppen Gallery, London), to produce a series of 27 vast digital prints of images taken by the photographer.

Walker´s obsession with 15th century Netherlandish Master, Hieronymus Bosch, led him to create his own take on his famous paiting the Garden of Earthly Delights. Together with set designer, Shona Heath, the photographer recreated the key elements from a Boschian world. The shoot, which took place over five days at Eglingham Hall in Northumberland, produced a series of sensational, symbolic and highly sensory photographs, filled with exquisitely sensual characters and objects, and deeply striking mise-en-scène.

The prints, which can now be found at Nicola Erni´s private collection in Zug, Switzerland, were materialised by Factum Arte, and are a result of several material and technological innovations which have been taking place within the Factum Arte studios over several years.

Tim Walker´s work will be on view at the Noordbrabants Museum in the Netherlands as part of the exhibition: Tim Walker: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Bosch through the eyes of a fashion photographer (November 4 - February 25, 2018)

<div class="description" title="This is one of the few shots I have of Selma (Sheila) before her transformation. Here, she is at the beach with my family, watching my grandmother&#x27;s dog, Mishka, or Mickey for short, a Wirehair Terrier make friends with a poodle during an outing. This is probably Long Island, and I believe it was about a year before my family built a home in East Patchogue, which back then was simply part of Bellport, and moved from Woodside, Queens. 

Selma&#x27;s life is a mystery to me. All I know is that she and my mother were childhood friends. I think her father owned a candy/ ice cream shop. I don&#x27;t even know if she had siblings. She was Jewish and very insecure about her weight and appearance, but other than that, I don&#x27;t have much to go on.

Sometime in 1957, after visiting Mom and me when I was a little tot, Selma, who had changed her name to Sheila, killed herself with a drug overdose because her husband didn&#x27;t want to be married anymore. It was a shock to my mother, who got the suicide letter written to her as a dear friend, when Selma&#x27;s mother mailed it after the police did an inquest. Mom saved the letter for the rest of her life. After she died, I found it when going through her things. 

I can&#x27;t even describe how holding that letter in my hands made me feel. Knowing that right after it was written, this poor woman took her own life was overwhelmingly powerful. I could almost feel her pain and despondency as I read her last words. It was as if a spirit of pain and hopelessness was attached to that piece of paper. I took it to the kitchen sink and burned it. I know that sometimes objects seem to be linked to a person somehow, and knowing that my own mother had suffered chronic depression for years, and had mentioned not wanting to live on more than one occasion, (all the time) and that even I had had overwhelming bouts of depression when I was young, I thought getting rid of that object was the best thing to do. I still believe it was. There was a heaviness to it, and that is gone. 

I can identify with Selma/ Sheila. Having been overweight much of my life, and feeling like I didn&#x27;t fit in, I understand depression. I also understand wishing I could make myself be someone I&#x27;m not sometimes, although I don&#x27;t dislike as much about myself as this poor woman seemed to. We live in a world where people expect perfection, even if they know deep down that it&#x27;s unattainable. Young women (and men like Michael Jackson) go to great lengths to alter themselves. 

If you, or someone you know, are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please get help. There is always someone who will feel pain at your passing; someone who cared, even if you don&#x27;t realize how much. Each of our lives is important, and you were created for a purpose, even if it doesn&#x27;t seem important enough to you. It&#x27;s important to God, and to the rest of the world that depends upon you to fill your place in it. 

I was at the brink of suicide many years ago. I know what that feels like, but I also know that if you ride it out, hope comes in the morning, and on the other side of that depression life awaits. Give that life a chance. Get help. Find someone ELSE to help. You may be the one who stops someone else from wasting their life and throwing in the towel!

Sheila would never know that many others would read her story. Decades after she died, she IS remembered. I hope that her life can now help someone else. If I can care about her, and WE can care about her so many years after the fact, it just shows that life is precious. Yours is, too.">

Historically, attributes artists breach amid those who go big and those who break small: depicting solid landscapes or brief phenomena. That bisect doesn’t absolutely administer to the carve of Emilie Brzezinski and Dalya Luttwak, who are assuming calm in the American University Museum’s “Finding a Path.” Although Brzezinski’s chain-sawed tree-trunk pieces are burlier, Luttwak renders roots and seedlings in steel, not absolutely a aerial material.

The abutting sculptures on affectation in the alfresco carve amplitude are billed as “a conversation.” Brzezinski’s and Luttwak’s site-specific pieces are placed abutting calm but mostly abide separate. Any of the genitalia could be apparent independently, alike the two pieces of “Mother Earth,” which snakes a gold-painted metal backcountry through a hollowed-out trunk.

The added duets are beneath intimate. “Split Open” comprises two board forms that resemble behindhand of an oversize, split-open nut, one ancillary of which sits on a coil of white animate twigs. Three cut logs are the accumbent aspect of “Cedars and Vines,” allegory vertical tendrils, all red save for one in black, that aisle the accurate wall.

The brutalist, greenery-free carve garden is both a accomplishments and capital to the compositions. In a sense, both Brzezinski and Luttwak assignment with begin objects, although Brzezinski hacks absolute trees, and Luttwak replicates the forms of absolute vegetation. For this matchup, the third banal is the amplitude itself.

Several of Luttwak’s sculptures, all corrective gold, are included in Watergate Gallery’s “Origin.” The appearance pairs them with collage-paintings by Arrigo Musti, an Italian who met Luttwak aback both apparent at the 2011 Venice Biennale. Their art is apparent side-by-side, not check-to-cheek as in Luttwak’s ball with Brzezinski.

Musti applies acrylic by decrepit rather than brushing, and he incorporates lace, cilia and added abstracts into his work. The ablaze colors and apart gestures arise contemporary, but best of the images are modeled on age-old Greek and Roman frescoes and mosaics. From a distance, the layers and textures advance artworks fabricated with adobe and adhesive and damaged by millennia of wear. Apparent up close, however, Musti’s pictures acknowledge a randomness that is annihilation but classical.

The artisan accepted as HKS 181 draws with pencil on paper, announcement a able of faculty of design. This affection is aggregate by Asad Walker, whose clean-lined “Skull” ability abode to either a accumulated business close or a motorcycle gang.

Alicia “Decoy” Cosnahan combines graphic-novel artlessness with Catholic imagery, and in one account adds the 1980s D.C.-punk adumbration that replaces the stars in the D.C. banderole with X’s. If Cosnahan has a beneath ballsy appearance than Del Valle, both arena austere capacity with bounded details. The streets these artists aggrandize are ones that D.C. citizenry airing daily.

&lt;b&gt;Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311&lt;/b&gt;

By Tim Hipps
FMWRC Public Affairs

ALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…

Retired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…

Staff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…

…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.

There were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.

“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”

Winners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp;amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.

Walker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. 

The subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.

“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.

“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”

Walker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.

About five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.

“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”

What does Walker enjoy most about photography?

“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”

Pugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”

Pugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.

“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”

Piedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.

“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”

The subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.

“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”

So what’s real?

“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.

“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”

Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.

“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”

Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. 

“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.

“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”

As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.

“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”

Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” 

Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. 

Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”

Lt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”

Staff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.

	<p><p>PHOTO CAPTION:   Awarded Honorable Mention Sunset over Gillis by CPT MATTHEW HOLDEN - Division 1 Active Duty Military</p>&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.Facebook.com/FamilyMWR" rel="nofollow">www.Facebook.com/FamilyMWR</a></p>&nbsp;<p><b>Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311</b></p>&nbsp;<p>By Tim Hipps</p><p>FMWRC Public Affairs</p>&nbsp;<p>ALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…</p>&nbsp;<p>Retired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…</p>&nbsp;<p>Staff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…</p>&nbsp;<p>…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.</p>&nbsp;<p>There were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.</p>&nbsp;<p>“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Winners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.</p>&nbsp;<p>Walker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. </p>&nbsp;<p>The subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.</p>&nbsp;<p>“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Walker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.</p>&nbsp;<p>About five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.</p>&nbsp;<p>“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”</p>&nbsp;<p>What does Walker enjoy most about photography?</p>&nbsp;<p>“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Pugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Pugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”</p>&nbsp;<p>The subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.</p>&nbsp;<p>“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”</p>&nbsp;<p>So what’s real?</p>&nbsp;<p>“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.</p>&nbsp;<p>“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.</p>&nbsp;<p>“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. </p>&nbsp;<p>“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.</p>&nbsp;<p>“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”</p>&nbsp;<p>As is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.</p>&nbsp;<p>“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Piedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” </p>&nbsp;<p>Several other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. </p>&nbsp;<p>Holly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Lt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”</p>&nbsp;<p>Staff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>SIDEBAR:</p>&nbsp;<p>Here are the results of the top three finishers in each category with photographer’s rank, name, installation and photo title:</p>&nbsp;<p>2010 Army Digital Photo Contest</p><p>Division I </p>&nbsp;<p>Animals – 1.

&lt;b&gt;Linton&lt;/b&gt; is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. The population as of the 2011 census was 176. It is to the immediate south, and across the River Wharfe, from Grassington, near Threshfield and eight miles north of the market town Skipton. The green of this small village is set among an old Vanbrugh almshouse, a pub and three stone bridges over its beck. Not far to its north-east, Linton Beck runs down to the River Wharfe at the limestone Linton Falls, there bridged for walkers on a path up the Wharfe&#x27;s north bank to Grassington.   Amidst the group of cottages close by the Falls is a 14th century, packhorse bridge, &#x27;Little Emily&#x27;s Bridge&#x27;, a few minutes&#x27; walk from the church of Saint Michael and All Saints. Dating from the 12th century, Linton Church (as it is usually called) spreads an apron of churchyard, decorated with buttercups and gravestones, upon a small river plain bounded by a bend to its east of the Wharfe, as it flows from the Falls toward Burnsall, along the Dales Way. Except at high water, the river is crossed near the churchyard by an ancient course of stepping-stones, below an old (now renovated) mill house.">

Instead, his thesis is that a properly operated and well-resourced bus system is much more efficient from a coverage, cost, space, and equality perspective.\n\nConsider this an ongoing discussion about Urban Tech, its intersection with regulation, issues of public service, and other complexities that people have full PHDs on.  I’m just a bitter, born-and-bred New Yorker trying to figure out why I’ve been stuck in between subway stops for the last 15 minutes, so please reach out with your take on any of these thoughts: @Arman.Tabatabai@techcrunch.com.\n\nFrom an output perspective, Walker argues that by operating along variable routes based on at-your-door pick ups, microtransit actually takes more time to pick up fewer people on average. Walker also gives buses the edge from a cost and input perspective, since labor makes up 70% of transit operating costs in a pre-autonomous world and buses allow you to service more customers for the price of one driver.\n\n“The driver’s time is far more expensive than maintenance, fuel, and all the other costs involved.  In almost every public meeting I attend, citizens complain about seeing buses with empty seats, lecturing me about how smaller vehicles would be less wasteful. But that’s not the case. Because the cost is in the driver, a wise transit agency runs the largest bus it will ever need during the course of a shift. In an outer suburb, that empty big bus makes perfect sense if it will be mobbed by schoolchildren or commuters twice a day.”\n\nBut transit is not solely an issue of volume and unit economics, but one of managing public space. Walker explains that to ensure citizens don’t use more than their fair share of space, cities can either provide vehicles that are only marginally bigger than a human body, i.e. bikes and scooters, or have many people share large-scale vehicles, i.e. mass transit. Doing the latter through a mass fleet of on-demand microtransit solutions, Walker argues, increases congestion and makes it harder to manage scheduling and allocate infrastructure.\n\nWhile the article offers an effective comparison of unit economics and acts as a useful primer on the various considerations for city transit agencies, some of the conclusions are a bit binary.  The discussion is a bit singular in its focus of microtransit as a replacement of public transit rather than an additive service and doesn’t give much credit to the trip planning and space management capabilities of many microtransit services, nor changes in consumer expectations towards transportation.\n\nBut despite some of the gaps in the piece, Walker highlights two ideas that spill over to some broad areas that have caught my interest lately: Tolls and Parking.\n\nTolls\n\nPhoto by Michael H via Getty Images\n\n“To succeed, microtransit would have to help people get around cities better, not just make them feel good about hailing a ride on a phone. Full automation of vehicles, if indeed it ever arrives, might solve the labor problem—although it would put thousands of drivers out of work. But the congestion problem will remain.”\n\nLike many, Walker argues that ridesharing aggravates city traffic rather than alleviates it.  Even though ridesharing’s long-term impact on traffic is widely contested, nearly everyone agrees that a solution to urban congestion is desperately needed.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that regardless of the discourse that surrounds them, trends in US tolling mechanisms seem to suggest American cities may be moving closer to congestion pricing methods.\n\nAs an example, solutions to congestion are top of mind behind the New York state election that saw Democrats taking control of both state legislative houses. Though it seems like the argument resurfaces every few years, the elections have brought renewed debate over the possible implementation of congestion pricing in New York City.  In essence, congestion pricing is a system where drivers would pay higher prices for using high-traffic streets or entering high-traffic zones, allowing cities to better dictate the flow of drivers and reduce congestion.   \n\nOutside of the obvious political tension created by effectively implementing a new tax, some lawmakers have pushed back on the effectiveness of a congestion pricing policy, with some arguing that it can aggravate income inequality or that a policy addressing construction and pedestrians, rather than vehicles, would have a bigger impact on traffic.\n\nHowever, over the past year or so, an increasing number of states have been rolling out highway tolls that are priced dynamically, instead of using traditional fixed-price tolls. The exact drivers behind the toll prices vary, with some cities charging prices based on traffic conditions and others charging varying prices for the use of express and HOV lanes.\n\nSeveral new technologies and companies have also made it easier for local governments to implement more sophisticated, adjustable toll pricing or congestion fees at a much lower cost. In the past, congestion pricing systems around the world have required physical detection systems that can be extremely costly to implement.\n\nNow, companies like ClearRoad are helping governments use a wide range of connected vehicle technologies to establish and collect road usage pricing from any location without the need for physical infrastructure. Oregon is one geography working with ClearRoad to manage its new opt-in road usage program where the state is able to calculate drivers’ usage of certain roads and their gas consumption, and then reimburse them for gas taxes they’re paying.\n\nSo even though people are still screaming at each other in state capitols, it seems like we may be closer to seeing congestion pricing in major cities than we think. And while executing these programs can be difficult and painfully slow (often needing to satisfy city regulations and tax laws forty layers deep), if these smaller-scale programs we’re seeing in the US are actually effective, congestion pricing may be a solution to plug chunky budget gaps, better finance infrastructure projects and replace lost gas tax revenue in an electric vehicle future.\n\nParking\n\nIn his piece, Walker goes back to some basic principles of urban design, highlighting that at their core, functioning cities come down to how millions of people share a comparatively tiny amount of space.  \n\nWalker explains that city dwellers that travel with cars and solo rideshare trips rather than with large-scale shared transit are effectively taking up more than their fair share of public space.  While the argument is made in the context of ridesharing and congestion, the same idea applies to the less-discussed impact mass-transit ridesharing can have on city parking.\n\nAt least in the near-term, certain cities have seen ridesharing actually increase vehicle usage rather than reduce it (a claim rideshare companies dispute), resulting in an even wider gap between the supply and demand for available parking spots.  And if people are using ridesharing but still choosing to own cars regardless, in an indirect fashion, they are similarly reducing the stock of available parking space by more than their fair share.\n\nAnd while it makes sense that rideshare vehicles should receive a larger portion of the parking stock, given that it serves more passengers, the use of available parking by these vehicles can and has caused tension with local residents that have to store their cars further away.\n\nThere are companies like the mobility-focused data platform, Coord, that are working on tools geared towards helping cities and citizens more effectively allocate and plan parking strategies for the future multi-modal transportation network. And theoretically, ridesharing should reduce the number of vehicles in search of parking in the long-term. But at least for now, the impact on parking congestion is just another unintended consequence that weakens the argument for ridesharing as mass transit.\n\nAnd lastly, some reading while in transit:\n\nA Smart City Is an Accessible City – The Atlantic, Aimi Hamraie\n\nThe DEA and ICE Are Hiding Surveillance Cameras in Streetlights – Quartz, Justin Rohrlich &amp; David Gershgron\n\nWhen Amazon Happens to Good Cities – Planetizen, James Brasuell\n\nIn the Age of A.I., Is Seeing Still Believing? – The New Yorker, Joshua Rothman\n\nThe Social Responsibility of Wakanda’s Golden City – CityLab, Nicole Flatow\n\nHow issues of microtransit, congestion and parking are closing in on cities syndicated from <a href=\"https:\/\/antitheftbackpacks.wordpress.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">antitheftbackpacks.wordpress.com\/<\/a>\n","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_m.jpg","width":240,"height":159,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_t.jpg","width":100,"height":66,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_b.jpg","width":680,"height":452,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_z.jpg","width":640,"height":425,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_n.jpg","width":320,"height":213,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4879\/44015394770_7313e0efb5_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":680,"oHeight":452,"isPublic":true,"id":"44015394770"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"unawhite","username":"unawhite","realname":"Jasmine Allen","ownerNsid":"140885971@N03","title":"How issues of microtransit, congestion and parking are closing in on cities","description":"via WordPress <a href=\"https:\/\/ift.tt\/2Qzfjid\" rel=\"nofollow\">ift.tt\/2Qzfjid<\/a>\n\nEarlier this week in a new experimental newsletter I’ve been helping Danny Crichton on, we briefly discussed transit pundit Jarrett Walker’s article in The Atlantic arguing against the view that ridesharing and microtransit will be the future of mass transit.

When large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland, this large fortified manor house was probably also built.\n\nIn 1438, John Brome, the Under Treasurer of England, bought the manor. It then passed to his son, Nicholas, who is thought to have built the East Range, which is the main entrance. Nicholas is also responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby church of St Michael's, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edmond Ferrers. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust. Henry Ferrers &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1549-1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family's coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. He is likely responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the East Range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building. In the 19th century, the house's Catholic Chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael's Church, which shares much history with the house, and is wonderful to visit in its own right, is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used. The stained glass throughout is also a nice feature.","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_m.jpg","width":240,"height":168,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_t.jpg","width":100,"height":70,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":715,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_b.jpg","key":"b"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_n.jpg","width":320,"height":223,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/165\/439819305_18b36073c7_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":2048,"oHeight":1430,"isPublic":true,"id":"439819305"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"evanleavittphotography","username":"evanleavittphotography","realname":"Evan Leavitt","ownerNsid":"8544019@N06","faveCount":38,"commentCount":69,"title":"Idiot Box","description":"Athens, GA \nClarke County\nBare Bones Project\n<a href=\"http:\/\/bighugelabs.com\/flickr\/onblack.php?id=3526121644&amp;size=large\">View On Black<\/a>\n\nExplored!","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_m.jpg","width":180,"height":240,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_t.jpg","width":75,"height":100,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_b.jpg","width":768,"height":1024,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_b.jpg","key":"b"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_n.jpg","width":320,"height":427,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3629\/3526121644_cbba06ceb9_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":2736,"oHeight":3648,"isPublic":true,"id":"3526121644"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"edwarddullardphotography","username":"edwarddullardphotography","realname":"Edward Dullard Photography.

The larger island Great Saltee is the most famous bird sanctuary in Ireland and is very popular with both day-trippers and birdwatchers. These Islands are privately owned and are one of the world's major bird sanctuaries.\n\nThe Saltees are a haven for sea birds, nurturing an impressive array of birds, from Gannets and Gulls to Puffins and Manx Shearwaters. They also lie on an important migratory route and a popular stopping-off place for spring and autumn migrants. The Great Saltee also has a breeding population of Grey Seals, one of the very few in eastern Ireland. Up to 120 animals are present in autumn and up to 20 pups are produced annually. \n\nThese Islands are among the ancient islands of Europe, based on Pre-Cambrian bedrock i.e. between 600 and 2000 million years old. There is archaeological evidence that Neolithic man settled there, and traces of religious settlements exist. There is also evidence of buccaneering and smuggling. A flourishing period in the history of the islands was from about 1500 - 1800 when they were a base for pirates, wreckers and smugglers. The gains of the wreckers and smugglers could very well be hidden in the many caves which have mysterious and romantic names - Lady Walker's Cave, Happy Hole, Otter's Cave and Hell Hole, enough for any Treasure Island. These and other caves can be clearly seen on The Great Saltee Map (Information Page).\n\nThe waters around the islands can be treacherous, hence the area is know as the &quot;Graveyard of a Thousand Ships&quot; and the islands their tombstones.\n\nOne of the most spectacular sights on the Saltees in mid-Summer are the sea birds colonies on the cliffs to the north-east of the Gannet headland. Vast numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills pack the ledges and create a frightful incessant din which only at night abates a little. The Fulmars too play their part in this splendour. Towards dusk the sight of the Puffins congregating in small groups near their nestling sites presents a marvellous sight. \n\nIf the Saltees had any other name before their present title, it has been long lost. As for the origin of the name there are two possible theories, Norse or of Old or Middle English derivation. However the name suggests a Norse origin (Salt ey - salt island) derived from the phenomenon of the salty spray which sweeps across the islands at times of high winds and waves, especially during the winter. \n\nSince December 1943 the Saltees are privately owned by the Neale family. Prince Michael the First died in January 1998 and is buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay, Co.Wexford. He has been succeeded by his eldest son Michael the Second. \n\nPermission for day visits to the Great Saltee, by courtesy of the Neale family, is not needed. Permission to visit the Little Saltee can not be granted due to the hazardous landing conditions.  However we would like all visitors to respect these islands and in the words of the late Prince Michael the First.\n\n \n\n \n\n&quot;All people, young and old, are welcome to come, see and enjoy the Islands, and\n leave them as they found them for the unborn generations to come, see and enjoy.&quot;\n\n                                                                                                           Michael the First\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThese sentiments expressed and carved in stone welcomes all visitors to these islands, erected above the landing steps on the Great Saltee.","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_m.jpg","width":240,"height":160,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_t.jpg","width":100,"height":67,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":682,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_z.jpg","width":640,"height":426,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_n.jpg","width":320,"height":213,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5269\/5730962091_7bba2e0456_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":1024,"oHeight":682,"isPublic":true,"id":"5730962091"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"edwarddullardphotography","username":"edwarddullardphotography","realname":"Edward Dullard Photography.

In Dublin newspapers appeared a personal pronouncement: &quot;I, Prince Michael Neale, landowner, will assume the title of Prince of the Saltees at the conclusion of the war. Also I wish it to be known that no one will be permitted to enter the Saltee Islands without a permit issued by me.&quot; Anybody caught interfering with the millions of birds or their eggs which inhabit those islands will be severely dealt with.\n\nPrince Michael Neale is Eire's No. 1 manufacturer of cattle dip. As a County Wexford farmer's son, he used to lie on a cliff top in the long grass and gaze south across St. George's Channel to the tiny, haze-blue Saltee Islands. Since his first name was legally Prince, it was easy for a farm boy to daydream: &quot;Some day I'll own those islands and become a real prince.&quot; He took to calling the Saltees &quot;Paradise.&quot;\n\nBy last year he had sold enough dip to buy the Saltees. He began planting 3,000 trees, developing his domain as a luxury tourist resort. He also talked about recruiting a private army.\n\nBut last week Prince Neale had a right royal headache. To a reporter the Dublin prince-presumptive confided: &quot;My wife, a Liverpool woman, is a bit shy about using the title of Princess. . . .&quot; He added thoughtfully: &quot;Anyone who does not call me Prince will be ignored.&quot;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe late Michael the First was both a colourful character and a legend in his own life time. Married to Anne he is survived by his family of five sons and one daughter. Both Michael and Anne are buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay Co.Wexford.\n\nIn around the year 1920 the nine year old Michael made a vow to his Mother that one day he would own the Saltees and become their first Prince. Twenty three years later in December 1943 he realised his dream.  However his coronation on the Great Saltee did not take place until July 1956.\n \n \nA throne, flag-staff and obelisk were shipped to the Great Saltee, the obelisk bearing a plaque with his likeness in profile. The throne is a memorial to his mother and features a coat of arms and the following inscription: \n \n \n \n&quot;This chair is erected in memory of my mother to whom I made a vow when I was ten years old that one day I would own the Saltee Islands and become the First Prince of the Saltees.  Henceforth my heirs and successors can only proclaim themselves Prince of these Islands by sitting in this chair fully garbed in the robes and crown of the Islands and take the Oath of Succession&quot;  -  Michael the First.\n \n \n \n \nOne of the first jobs undertook on the Great Saltee was the levelling of a field in the centre of the island as a landing strip for his private airplanes. He was taught to fly by Capt.Darby Kennedy (Weston Aerodrome) and regularly flew his Miles Messenger aircraft to the islands. Between 1945 and 1950 over 34,000 trees and shrubs were planted on the island. The most successful of these were Cordyline Palms, which are flourishing to this day.  \nThe Newspaper articles worldwide regarding Michel the First are in their hundreds.  \n&quot;It was never my intention to make a profit from these islands.  Day visitors are welcome to come and enjoy at no cost.  Bird watchers will always remain welcome.&quot; - Michael the First. \n \n \n\n \n \nTo this day the Neale family have upheld his wishes.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n The Saltee Islands, consisting of the Great and Little Saltee, St. Georges Channel are situated approximately 5 kilometres off the coast of Kilmore Quay Co.Wexford.

When large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland, this large fortified manor house was probably also built.\n\nIn 1438, John Brome, the Under Treasurer of England, bought the manor. It then passed to his son, Nicholas, who is thought to have built the East Range, which is the main entrance. Nicholas is also responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby church of St Michael's, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edmond Ferrers. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust. Henry Ferrers &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1549-1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family's coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. He is likely responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the East Range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building. In the 19th century, the house's Catholic Chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael's Church, which shares much history with the house, and is wonderful to visit in its own right, is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used. The stained glass throughout is also a nice feature.","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_m.jpg","width":240,"height":159,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_t.jpg","width":100,"height":66,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":678,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_b.jpg","key":"b"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_n.jpg","width":320,"height":212,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/184\/439846471_2d7e827b46_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":2048,"oHeight":1355,"isPublic":true,"id":"439846471"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"julesfoto","username":"julesfoto","realname":"Jules","ownerNsid":"55578087@N08","title":"UK - Cornwall - Near Marazion - St Michael's Mount - Castle - Looking down on garden","description":"May 2018.\nCapital Walkers weekend away in Penzance.\nSt Michael's Mount is managed by the National Trust.

Kilkenny, Ireland.","ownerNsid":"78099783@N00","faveCount":13,"commentCount":88,"title":"SALTEE ISLAND IMPRESSIONS.","description":"The Saltee Islands, consisting of the Great and Little Saltee, St. Georges Channel are situated approximately 5 kilometres off the coast of Kilmore Quay Co.Wexford. The larger island Great Saltee is the most famous bird sanctuary in Ireland and is very popular with both day-trippers and birdwatchers. These Islands are privately owned and are one of the world's major bird sanctuaries.\n\nThe Saltees are a haven for sea birds, nurturing an impressive array of birds, from Gannets and Gulls to Puffins and Manx Shearwaters. They also lie on an important migratory route and a popular stopping-off place for spring and autumn migrants. The Great Saltee also has a breeding population of Grey Seals, one of the very few in eastern Ireland. Up to 120 animals are present in autumn and up to 20 pups are produced annually. \n\nThese Islands are among the ancient islands of Europe, based on Pre-Cambrian bedrock i.e. between 600 and 2000 million years old. There is archaeological evidence that Neolithic man settled there, and traces of religious settlements exist. There is also evidence of buccaneering and smuggling. A flourishing period in the history of the islands was from about 1500 - 1800 when they were a base for pirates, wreckers and smugglers. The gains of the wreckers and smugglers could very well be hidden in the many caves which have mysterious and romantic names - Lady Walker's Cave, Happy Hole, Otter's Cave and Hell Hole, enough for any Treasure Island. These and other caves can be clearly seen on The Great Saltee Map (Information Page).\n\nThe waters around the islands can be treacherous, hence the area is know as the &quot;Graveyard of a Thousand Ships&quot; and the islands their tombstones.\n\nOne of the most spectacular sights on the Saltees in mid-Summer are the sea birds colonies on the cliffs to the north-east of the Gannet headland. Vast numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills pack the ledges and create a frightful incessant din which only at night abates a little. The Fulmars too play their part in this splendour. Towards dusk the sight of the Puffins congregating in small groups near their nestling sites presents a marvellous sight. \n\nIf the Saltees had any other name before their present title, it has been long lost. As for the origin of the name there are two possible theories, Norse or of Old or Middle English derivation. However the name suggests a Norse origin (Salt ey - salt island) derived from the phenomenon of the salty spray which sweeps across the islands at times of high winds and waves, especially during the winter. \n\nSince December 1943 the Saltees are privately owned by the Neale family. Prince Michael the First died in January 1998 and is buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay, Co.Wexford. He has been succeeded by his eldest son Michael the Second. \n\nPermission for day visits to the Great Saltee, by courtesy of the Neale family, is not needed. Permission to visit the Little Saltee can not be granted due to the hazardous landing conditions.  However we would like all visitors to respect these islands and in the words of the late Prince Michael the First.\n\n \n\n \n\n&quot;All people, young and old, are welcome to come, see and enjoy the Islands, and\n leave them as they found them for the unborn generations to come, see and enjoy.&quot;\n\n                                                                                                           Michael the First\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThese sentiments expressed and carved in stone welcomes all visitors to these islands, erected above the landing steps on the Great Saltee.","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_m.jpg","width":240,"height":240,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_t.jpg","width":100,"height":100,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_b.jpg","width":1022,"height":1022,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_z.jpg","width":640,"height":640,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_n.jpg","width":320,"height":320,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5146\/5725471831_aa9da95517_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":1022,"oHeight":1022,"isPublic":true,"id":"5725471831"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"159573320@N02","realname":"Painting Nature","ownerNsid":"159573320@N02","title":"21 Important Life Lessons Define Mixed Media Painting Taught Us | define mixed media painting","description":"via WordPress <a href=\"https:\/\/ift.tt\/2QJGwPw\" rel=\"nofollow\">ift.tt\/2QJGwPw<\/a>\n\nAnne Yoncha doesn’t bethink absolutely what she was account back the chat “ecotone” sprung up off the page, into her head.

In 2015, the festival welcomed 93,000 visitors.\n\nThe specially designed exhibitions, often organised in collaboration with French and foreign museums and institutions, take place in various historic sites. Some venues, such as 12th-century chapels or 19th-century industrial buildings, are open to the public throughout the festival.\n\nThe Rencontres d’Arles has revealed many photographers, confirming its significance as a springboard for photography and contemporary creativity.\n\nIn recent years the Rencontres d’Arles has invited many guest curators and entrusted some of its programming to such figures as Martin Parr in 2004, Raymond Depardon in 2006 and the Arles-born fashion designer Christian Lacroix.\nContents\n\n    1 Art directors\n    2 The festival\n    3 The Rencontres d'Arles award winners\n    4 Exhibitions\n    5 References\n    6 External links\n\nArt directors\nA photographer, Jean-Pierre Sudre, discussing his work, Rencontres d'Arles, 1975\n\n    1970 - 1972: Lucien Clergue, Michel Tournier, Jean-Maurice Rouquette\n    1973 - 1976: Lucien Clergue\n    1977: Bernard Perrine\n    1978: Jacques Manachem\n    1979 - 1982: Alain Desvergnes (fr)\n    1983 - 1985: Lucien Clergue\n    1986 - 1987: François Hébel\n    1988 - 1989: Claude Hudelot (fr)\n    1990: Agnès de Gouvion Saint-Cyr\n    1991 - 1993: Louis Mesplé (fr)\n    1994: Lucien Clergue\n    1995 - 1998, délégué général: Bernard Millet (fr)\n        1995, artistic director: Michel Nuridsany (fr)\n        1996, artistic director: Joan Fontcuberta\n        1997, artistic director: Christian Caujolle (fr)\n        1998, artistic director: Giovanna Calvenzi\n    1999 - 2001: Gilles Mora (fr)\n    2002 - 2014: François Hébel\n    Since 2015: Sam Stourdzé (fr)\n\nThe festival\nA photography exhibition, Rencontres d'Arles, 2010\nEvents\n\nOpening week at the Rencontres d’Arles features photography-focused events (projections at night, exhibition tours, panel discussions, symposia, parties, book signings, etc.) in the town’s historic venues, some of which are only open to the public during the festival. Memorable events in recent years include Europe Night (2008), an overview of European photography; Christian Lacroix’s fashion show for the festival’s closing (2008); and Patti Smith’s concert for the Vu agency’s 20th anniversary (2006).\nNights at the Roman Theatre\n\nAt night, work by a photographer or a photography expert is projected in the town’s open-air Roman theatre accompanied by concerts and performances. Each event is a one-off creation. In 2009, 8,500 people attended evenings at the Roman theatre, an average of 2,000 a night, and 2,500 were there on closing night, when the Tiger Lilies played during a projection of Nan Goldin’s “The Ballad of Sexual Dependency”. In 2013 over 6,000 people attended the nighttime photography projections, an average of approximately 1,000 each night.\nThe Night of the Year\n\nThe Night of the Year, which was created in 2006, allows visitors to walk around and see the festival’s favourite works by artists and photographers as well as carte blanche exhibitions by institutions.\nCosmos-Arles Books\n\nCosmos-Arles Books is a Rencontres d’Arles satellite event dedicated to new publishing practices.\n\nOver the past 15 years large-scale photographic publications, self-published books, and ebooks have become essential media for experimentation by photographers and artists. They allow photography to be rediscovered as a means of expression and distribution, providing a rich terrain of expression for the art’s fundamentally hybrid forms.\nSymposia and panel discussions\n\nPhotographers and professionals participating in symposia and panel discussions during opening week discuss their work or issues raised by the images on display. In recent years the themes included whether a black-and-white aesthetic is still conceivable in photography (2013); the impact of social networks on creativity and information (2011); breaking with past, a key idea for photography today (2009); photography commissions: freedom or constraint (2008); challenges and changes in the photography market (2007).\nThe Rencontres d’Arles awards\n\nSince 2002 the Rencontres d’Arles awards have been an opportunity to discover new talents. In 2007 the number of annual awards was reduced to three, presented at the closing ceremony of the festival’s professional week: the Discovery Award (€25,000), Author’s Book Award (€8,000) and History Book Award (€8,000).\nLuma Rencontres Dummy Book Award\n\nIn 2015 the Rencontres d’Arles offered an award to assist with the publication of a dummy book. Endowed with a €25,000 budget production budget, this new prize is open to all photographers and artists using photography who submit a dummy book that has never been published.\n\nThe winner’s book will be produced in autumn 2015 and be presented at the 2016 Rencontres d’Arles.\nPhoto Folio Review &amp; Gallery\n\nSince 2006 aspiring photographers have been able to submit their portfolios to international photography experts in various fields, including publishers, exhibition curators, heads of institutions, agency directors, gallery owners, collectors, critics and photo editors, for appraisal during the festival’s opening week. Photo Folio Review &amp; Gallery offers them an opportunity to show their work throughout the festival.\nPhotography classes\n\nThe Rencontres d’Arles has always been a place where professional photographers and practitioners on every level have been able to meet each other and exchange ideas. Each year, photography class participants undertake a personal journey of creation through photography’s aesthetic, ethical and technological issues. Leading photographers such as Guy le Querrec, Antoine d’Agata, Martin Parr, René Burri and Joan Fontcuberta regularly teach at the Rencontres d’Arles.\nRentrée en Images\n\n“Rentrée en Images” has been a key part of the festival’s educational activities since 2004. During the first two weeks in September, special mediators take students from the primary to graduate school level on guided tours of the exhibitions. Based on the festival’s programming, the event aims to introduce young people to the visual arts and fits in with a wider policy of cultural democratisation. “Rentrée en Images” reaches thousands of students, and for many of them it is their first exposure to contemporary art.\nBudget\n\nPublic funding accounted for 40% of the 2015 festival’s €6.3-million budget, sales (mainly of tickets and derivative products), 40% and private partnerships, 20%[clarification needed][citation needed].\nExecutive Committee\n\n    Hubert Védrine, president\n    Hervé Schiavetti, vice-president\n    Jean-François Dubos, vice-president\n    Marin Karmitz, treasurer\n    Françoise Nyssen, secretary\n    Lucien Clergue, Jean-Maurice Rouquette, Michel Tournier, founding members\n\nThe Rencontres d'Arles award winners\n2002\n\n    Jury: Denis Curti, Alberto Anault, Alice Rose George, Manfred Heiting, Erik Kessels, Claudine Maugendre, Val Williams\n    Discovery Award: Peter Granser\n    No Limit award: Jacqueline Hassink\n    Dialogue of the humanity award: Tom Wood\n    Photographer of the year award: Roger Ballen\n    Help to the project: Pascal Aimar, Chris Shaw\n    Author’s Book Award: Sibusiso Mbhele and His Fish Helicopter by Koto Bolofo (powerHouse Books, 2002)\n    Help to publishing: Une histoire sans nom by Anne-Lise Broyer\n\n2003\n\n    Jury: Giovanna Calvenzi, Hou Hanru, Christine Macel, Anna Lisa Milella, Urs Stahel\n    Discovery Award: Zijah Gafic\n    No Limit award: Thomas Demand\n    Dialogue of the humanity award: Fazal Sheikh\n    Photographer of the year award: Anders Petersen\n    Help to the project: Jitka Hanzlova\n    Author’s Book Award: Hide That Can by Deirdre O’Callaghan (Trolley Books, 2002)\n    Help to publishing: A Personal Diary of Chinese Avant-Garde in the 1990s, China (1993-1998) by Xing Danwen\n\n2004\n\n    Jury: Eikoh Hosoe, Joan Fontcuberta, Tod Papageorge, Elaine Constantine, Antoine d’Agata\n    Discovery Award: Yasu Suzuka\n    No Limit award: Jonathan de Villiers\n    Dialogue of the humanity award: Edward Burtynsky\n    Help to the project: John Stathatos\n    Author’s Book Award: Particulars by David Goldblatt (Goodman Gallery, 2003)\n\n2005\n\n    Jury: Ute Eskildsen, Jean-Louis Froment, Michel Mallard, Kathy Ryan, Marta Gili\n    Discovery Award: Miroslav Tichy\n    No Limit award: Mathieu Bernard-Reymond\n    Dialogue of the humanity award: Simon Norfolk\n    Help to the project: Anna Malagrida\n    Author’s Book Award: Temporary Discomfort (Chapter I-V) by Jules Spinatsch (Lars Müller Publishers, 2005)\n\n2006\n\n    Jury: Vincent Lavoie, Abdoulaye Konaté, Yto Barrada, Marc-Olivier Wahler, Alain d’Hooghe\n    Discovery Award: Alessandra Sanguinetti\n    No Limit award: Randa Mirza\n    Dialogue of the humanity award: Wang Qingsong\n    Help to the project: Walid Raad\n    Author’s Book Award: Form aus Licht und Schatten by Heinz Hajek-Halke (Steidl, 2005)\n\n2007\n\n[1]\n\n    Jury: Bice Curiger, Alain Fleischer, Johan Sjöström, Thomas Weski, Anne Wilkes Tucker\n    Discovery Award: Laura Henno\n    Author’s Book Award: Empty Bottles by WassinkLundgren (Thijs groot Wassink and Ruben Lundgren) (Veenman Publishers, 2007)\n    Historical Book Award: László Moholy-Nagy: Color in Transparency: Photographic Experiments in Color, 1934–1946 by Jeannine Fiedler (Steidl &amp;

It is a unique and interesting feature, with an interesting history. The bridge is a low, curving construction, 130ft long, formed of 38 boulders spanned by slabs of stone, and takes walkers across a wide but shallow ford. This picturesque and remarkable Clapper Bridge takes its name from the word Clapper which is the plural for the Anglo-Saxon word 'Clam' and signifies a construction which is Roman in origin and consists of a row of two uprights crossed by a topping slab.\n\nThe area was formerly known locally as 'The Colony', but it's past is seldom talked about and few are willing to recall the memories of its brief and shameful existence. This is because it was really known as a &quot;Colony of Jumpers&quot;, so called because the village came into being as a result of the practice known as souperism.\n\nDuring the Famine many local people were forced to convert to protestantism just to gain sustenance. The local Church of Ireland Minister, the Rev. Callinan, was in the habit of providing soup to his congregation, who due to starvation were very vulnerable and so many catholics converted to the protestant faith just to survive.\n\nAs his congregation continued to expand, in 1853 Lord Sligo granted him an acre of land seven miles west of Louisbourgh, on which to build a new church. The church was dedicated in Irish and was attended by 300 people. As the location was in an extremely remote area and there were no roads as such, numbers began to fall and the congregation petered out.\n\nThe Society for the Protection of Rights of Conscience took control of the church. The Secretary of the Society, a man named Hogan leased a further 193 acres from Lord Sligo and proceed to build ten or twelve two bedroomed houses for the converts together with a school for its inhabitants.\n\nIn 1863 John Alexander, who built the 'Clapper Bridge' across the streams that separated the two rows of houses, replaced Hogan as Secretary of the Society. Much of this effort was in vain however as the local people (other than the converts) strongly objected to the presence of the society and did nothing to encourage their farming endeavours. After only twenty years the society disappeared from the district, although their teacher, a Miss Mc Greal, remained for some years in the living quarters of the school.\n\nRichard King purchased the land in 1878 from Lord Sligo for a figure of £650. Little remains today of the school and all that remains of the colony is the skeleton of 3 houses. The church was demolished in 1927 and all that is left are the entrance gates. The Clapper Bridge remains a unique and unusual monument, to a shameful period of Irish history.

I 411. Photo: RKO. Publicity still for <i>Tarzan's Hidden Jungle<\/i> (Harold D. Schuster, 1955). \n\nGood-looking and muscular American actor <b>Gordon Scott<\/b> (1926–2007) is best known as the eleventh Tarzan. He portrayed Tarzan in five films from 1955 to 1960. Then Scott moved to Italy, where he became a popular star of the Peplum film genre, the sword-and-sandal epics. As the Peplum faded, Scott starred in Spaghetti Westerns and Eurospy films.\n\nGordon Scott was born Gordon Merrill Werschkul in Portland, Oregon, in 1926. He was  one of nine children of advertising man Stanley Werschkul and his wife Alice. Scott was raised in Oregon and studied Physical Education at the University of Oregon for one semester. Upon leaving school, he joined the U.S. Army in 1944. He served as a drill sergeant and military policeman, and specialized in close order drill, judo and hand-to-hand combat. After his honorable discharge in 1947 he took on a variety of  jobs, including fireman, cowboy, and farm-machinery salesman. In 1953 he was working as a lifeguard at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas when he was spotted by Hollywood agents, Ed and Walter Mayers. They were impressed by his handsome features, muscular physique, and imposing height. Scott then beat out 200 contestants to replace Lex Barker as Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous jungle hero Tarzan. Film producer Sol Lesser offered him a 7 year contract, a loin cloth and a new last name. Reportedly, ‘Werschkul’ sounded too much like ‘Weissmuller’. So as Gordon Scott, he debuted in the low-budget Tarzan’s Hidden Jungle (Harold D. Schuster, 1955). It led to a romance with co-star Vera Miles, who became his wife in 1956. They divorced in 1959. Tarzan’s Hidden Jungle was followed by Tarzan and the Lost Safari (H. Bruce Humberstone, 1957), the first Tarzan film in colour. It was filmed in Nairobi, British East Africa. In his early Tarzan films, Scott played the character as unworldly and inarticulate, in the mold of Johnny Weissmuller. In 1958, Sol Lesser sold Scott's contract to Sy Weintraub. The new producer took his star to Paramount Pictures and, fueled by bigger production budgets, made two of the most successful Tarzan films, Tarzan's Greatest Adventure (John Guillermin, 1959) with Anthony Quayle and Sean Connery, and Tarzan the Magnificent (Robert Day, 1960) with Jock Mahoney. In these later films, Scott played a Tarzan who was educated and spoke perfect English, as in the original Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. Gordon Scott was the only actor to play Tarzan in both styles.\n\nFearing he would become typecast as Tarzan, Gordon Scott moved to Italy. There he became a popular star of the Peplum genre, the sword-and-sandal epics featuring handsome bodybuilders as various characters from Greek and Roman myth. Scott was an old training buddy of Hercules star Steve Reeves. Reeves had agreed to star in the Sergio Leone-penned saga Romolo e Remo\/Duel of the Titans (Sergio Corbucci, 1961) about the two brothers of Roman Mythology, who founded Rome. The producer wanted Reeves to play both Romulus and Remus, but Reeves objected that the film would be more effective with another actor in the role of Remus. He recommended Gordon Scott, and the film co-starred Virna Lisi, Laura Solari, Massimo Girotti  and Jacques Sernas. Scott was given the highest salary he had earned thus far for taking the role. Next followed Maciste alla corte del Gran Khan\/Maciste at the Court of the Great Khan (Riccardo Freda, 1961),  which reused the sets, extras and Yoko Tani as a princess from Marco Polo (Piero Pierotti, Hugo Fregonese, 1961) and Freda's I mongoli\/The Mongols (André De Toth, Leopoldo Savona, Riccardo Freda, 1961). He played Julius Caesar opposite Pascale Petit as Cleopatra in the historical drama Una regina per Cesare\/A Queen for Caesar (Piero Pierotti, Victor Tourjansky, 1962) set in Egypt in 48 BC. Unlike other films about Caesar and Cleopatra, this film focuses entirely on the dynastic struggle within Egypt leading up to the arrival of Caesar, and in fact, we only see him in the closing scene of the film when he arrives at The Ptolemaic Palace in Alexandria. 20th Century Fox bought the rights for the film to keep it out of release lest it compete with their own Cleopatra, featuring Elizabeth Taylor. Scott also played Hercules in a couple of international co-productions during the mid-1960s.\n \nAs the Peplum genre faded, Gordon Scott starred in other genre films. His first Spaghetti Western was Buffalo Bill, l'eroe del far west\/Buffalo Bill, Hero of the Far West (Mario Costa, 1964) with Jan Hendriks. He also starred in the Eurospy film Il Raggio infernale\/Danger!! Death Ray (Gianfranco Baldanello, 1967), released at a time when the James Bond films, and spy films in general, were very popular internationally. His early military combat and martial arts training made it possible for him to do many of his own stunts. His final film appearance was in the Spaghetti Western Gli uomini dal passo pesante\/The Tramplers (Albert Band,  Mario Sequi, 1966-1968) with Joseph Cotten and Franco Nero. He left Italy, and never made another film. He was trailed by a reputation as a ladies' man who seldom paid his bills, according to a 1987 article in the Toronto Star. For the last two decades of his life, Scott was a popular guest at film conventions and autograph shows and sold knives. In 2007, Gordon Scott died, aged 80, in Baltimore, Maryland, of lingering complications from multiple heart surgeries earlier in the year. Adam Bernstein in his obituary in The Washington Post:  “He lived with a series of obliging friends and ‘Tarzan’ fans, most recently in Baltimore. He had a troubled marriage to Miles, who apparently was under the impression that she was his first wife. She was his second or third, by varying accounts. He was seldom in contact with his surviving family, which includes a brother and two sisters. He had a son with Miles, and it's unclear how many other children he might have had. He was estranged from nearly everyone.” Scott was married three times. His first marriage was with Janice Mae Wynkoop, of Oakland, California. They met when he was a lifeguard at Lake Temescal, located in Oakland, California. The couple married in Reno, Nevada, in 1948, and had one child, Karen Judith Werschkul (1948), before divorcing in 1949. His second marriage was to a woman he met while they were both working at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas. Gordon as a lifeguard and his wife as a PBX operator.  They soon married and had a son, Eric, but the marriage ended once Gordon's acting career took off. With Vera Miles, he had one son, Michael, (1957).\n\nSources: Adam Bernstein (The Washington Post), Brian J.

Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…\n\nStaff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…\n\n…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.\n\nThere were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.\n\n“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”\n\nWinners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.\n\nWalker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. \n\nThe subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.\n\n“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.\n\n“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”\n\nWalker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.\n\nAbout five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.\n\n“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”\n\nWhat does Walker enjoy most about photography?\n\n“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”\n\nPugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”\n\nPugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”\n\nPiedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer.

But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”\n\nPiedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. \n\n“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.\n\n“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”\n\nAs is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.\n\n“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”\n\nPiedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” \n\nSeveral other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. \n\nHolly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”\n\nLt.

Walker's photo also was voted most popular in her division of the contest on Army Knowledge Online. (Photo by Brenda Walker)\n\n<b>Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest<\/b>\n\nBy Tim Hipps\nFMWRC Public Affairs\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…\n\nRetired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…\n\nStaff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…\n\n…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.\n\nThere were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.\n\n“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”\n\nWinners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.\n\nWalker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. \n\nThe subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.\n\n“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.\n\n“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”\n\nWalker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.\n\nAbout five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.\n\n“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”\n\nWhat does Walker enjoy most about photography?\n\n“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”\n\nPugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”\n\nPugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”\n\nPiedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.\n\n“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”\n\nThe subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.\n\n“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”\n\nSo what’s real?\n\n“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.\n\n“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”\n\nPiedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.\n\n“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible.

I saw a listing on the internet of the NME top 500 and it's set out below.  The stars indicate the albums that would probably make my personal top 500 and the check marks indicate albums I've listened to that don't make my personal top 500.   \n\nThis is in my sweet spot.  When a bunch of highly knowledgeable critics decide on the &quot;best ever' I'm going to seek that music out. They've heard more music than I ever have (there are 188 records on the list that I've never listened to). \n\nStill, I have some quibbles about the list.  The Smiths at #1?  I've never understood the appeal of the Smiths. I went back and listened again to &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; and found it just as unbearable as ever.  Maybe it's a British thing.\n\nSecond, no Robert Johnson or Hank Williams?  I'm betting this is because the list seems to ban compilation albums and Johnson and Williams recorded exclusively as singles artists.  But it just seems wrong to claim that the 500 best all time records don't include Hank Williams or Robert Johnson.\n\nThird, where are the great British folkies?  How can there be no Richard Thompson, no Fairport Convention, and no Pentangle? [Update: I see I'm wrong and that Fairport Convention is at #110.  Still, why no Richard Thompson?]\n\nFourth, the list seems to ignore most of the world (maybe there's a rule saying English language only).  But you can't have a list of the 500 best of all time with no Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and not a single album from Brazil. \n\nFifth, where's WIllie Nelson?\n\n-----------------------------\n★ - Would be on my personal Top 500\n✓ - Have listened to album and would not be in my personal Top 500\n? - Have listened to album and still undecided about it\n~ - Have listened to album and it stinks\n\n\n~1.

The house was probably established during the 13th century when large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is run by the National Trust. \n\nIn 1438, John Brome, Under-Treasurer of England, bought the manor, which passed to his son, Nicholas. Nicholas was responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby parish church dedicated to Saint Michael, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edward Ferrers (High Sheriff of Warwickshire) in 1500. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited it in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust, who now manage it.\n\nHenry Ferrers &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1549–1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family's coat of arms. Such glass now appears in many of the public rooms in the house. It is thought that he was responsible for building the great hall. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the east range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building.\n\nThe house was inhabited in the 1860s by the novelists Georgiana Chatterton and her second husband Edward Heneage Dering, both of whom converted to Catholicism. The house's Catholic chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive formal gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael's church, which shares much history with the house is just a few hundred yards up a lane. Inside the house are a beautiful great hall, parlour and library, amongst other rooms, and there is a great deal of 16th century carving and furniture to be seen, as well as the 19th century accessories the later inhabitants used.\n","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_m.jpg","width":240,"height":130,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_t.jpg","width":100,"height":54,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":554,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_z.jpg","width":640,"height":346,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_s.jpg","key":"s"},"c":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_c.jpg","width":800,"height":433,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_c.jpg","key":"c"},"f":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_2de9b6cdbd_f.jpg","width":4096,"height":2216,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_2de9b6cdbd_f.jpg","key":"f"},"h":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_63a5757209_h.jpg","width":1600,"height":866,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_63a5757209_h.jpg","key":"h"},"k":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_2267570d51_k.jpg","width":2048,"height":1108,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_2267570d51_k.jpg","key":"k"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_n.jpg","width":320,"height":173,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3928\/33938562552_a016bab31d_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":6000,"oHeight":3246,"isPublic":true,"id":"33938562552"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"familymwr","username":"familymwr","realname":"U.S. Army","ownerNsid":"36196762@N04","faveCount":20,"title":"Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311","description":"PHOTO CAPTION:  Awarded 1st Place 'Morning Serenity' by MIL FM BRENDA WALKER - Division 2 Other Eligible Patron\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.Facebook.com\/FamilyMWR\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.Facebook.com\/FamilyMWR<\/a>\n\n<b>Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311<\/b>\n\nBy Tim Hipps\nFMWRC Public Affairs\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…\n\nRetired Col.

After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.\n\n“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”\n\nWinners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.\n\nWalker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. \n\nThe subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.\n\n“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.\n\n“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”\n\nWalker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.\n\nAbout five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.\n\n“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”\n\nWhat does Walker enjoy most about photography?\n\n“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”\n\nPugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”\n\nPugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”\n\nPiedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.\n\n“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”\n\nThe subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.\n\n“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”\n\nSo what’s real?\n\n“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.\n\n“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”\n\nPiedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.\n\n“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”\n\nPiedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. \n\n“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.\n\n“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”\n\nAs is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.\n\n“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”\n\nPiedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” \n\nSeveral other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. \n\nHolly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”\n\nLt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”\n\nStaff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.\n\nSIDEBAR:\n\nHere are the results of the top three finishers in each category with photographer’s rank, name, installation and photo title:\n\n2010 Army Digital Photo Contest\nDivision I \n\nAnimals – 1.

Exactly a year later, Factum Arte was approached by Walker and Erni through an introduction by Michael Hoppen (founder &amp; director of the Michael Hoppen Gallery, London), to produce a series of 27 vast digital prints of images taken by the photographer.\n\nTim Walker, best known for working for many years as a commercial photographer for British, American and Italian Vogue, has exhibited his works at solo exhibitions for a number of years, in spaces such as Somerset House (2012), the Design Museum (2008) and the Bowes museum (2013). He also received numerous awards during the length of his career, including the Infinity Award for the International Center for Photography, and an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society.\n\nWalker´s obsession with 15th century Netherlandish Master, Hieronymus Bosch, led him to create his own take on his famous paiting the Garden of Earthly Delights. Together with set designer, Shona Heath, the photographer recreated the key elements from a Boschian world. The shoot, which took place over five days at Eglingham Hall in Northumberland, produced a series of sensational, symbolic and highly sensory photographs, filled with exquisitely sensual characters and objects, and deeply striking mise-en-scène.\n\nThe prints, which can now be found at Nicola Erni´s private collection in Zug, Switzerland, were materialised by Factum Arte, and are a result of several material and technological innovations which have been taking place within the Factum Arte studios over several years.\n\nTim Walker´s work will be on view at the Noordbrabants Museum in the Netherlands as part of the exhibition: Tim Walker: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Bosch through the eyes of a fashion photographer (November 4 - February 25, 2018)\nSource: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.factum-arte.com\/pag\/808\/Tim-Walker-br-i-The-Garden-of-Earthly-Delights-i-\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.factum-arte.com\/pag\/808\/Tim-Walker-br-i-The-Garden-of...<\/a>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.woth.co\/wothson\/the-garden-of-earthly-delights\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.woth.co\/wothson\/the-garden-of-earthly-delights\/<\/a>","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_m.jpg","width":160,"height":240,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_t.jpg","width":67,"height":100,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_b.jpg","width":683,"height":1024,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_z.jpg","width":427,"height":640,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_s.jpg","key":"s"},"c":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_c.jpg","width":533,"height":800,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_c.jpg","key":"c"},"f":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_1c751018ea_f.jpg","width":2731,"height":4096,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_1c751018ea_f.jpg","key":"f"},"h":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_ea11a4e143_h.jpg","width":1067,"height":1600,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_ea11a4e143_h.jpg","key":"h"},"k":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_04de54eae8_k.jpg","width":1365,"height":2048,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_04de54eae8_k.jpg","key":"k"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_n.jpg","width":213,"height":320,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4630\/25856882608_8907a98ce8_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":5472,"oHeight":3648,"isPublic":true,"id":"25856882608"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"navema","username":"navema","realname":"natasha marco","ownerNsid":"28488028@N06","faveCount":11,"commentCount":3,"title":"Gehry's Spiral Staircase","description":"South Wing of the Art Gallery of Ontario, 317 Dundas Street West, Toronto, Canada\n\nby navema\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.navemastudios.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.navemastudios.com<\/a>\n\nABOUT FRANK GEHRY’S AGO DESIGN:\n\nThe new AGO is Toronto-born Frank Gehry’s first building in Canada and marks the very place where he made the initial connection between art and architecture. Hallmarks of his AGO design connect the city and the Gallery in provocative new ways including dramatic sculptural staircases, the warmth of Douglas fir, and the extensive use of glass which infuses the galleries with natural light.\n\nFrom the outside of the gallery the most striking addition is the long glass façade that covers the Galleria Italia on the north side of the building. Below the glass wall, the gallery’s main entrance has been re-aligned with the center of the building. At the gallery’s south end, Gehry added the largest addition to the gallery through a new wing. This south wing is clad with blue-tinted titanium and house the gallery’s contemporary galleries. This wing is also pierced by two cantilevered serpent-like staircases on both sides.\n    \nUpon entering, visitors will see that Gehry has grouped the gallery’s bookstore, restaurant, theatre and café to the east. This commercial hub also includes the AGO’s free contemporary gallery. The atrium is linked to the gallery by a set of stairs and a winding ramp that snakes around an opening to the galleries below. directly ahead, Gehry has restored the historic walker court. However, the new walker court is anchored by a wood paneled serpent-like staircase, which breaks through the glass ceiling and joins the exterior stairs on the south wing’s north face.\n    \nInside the galleries, Gehry has exercised more subtlety giving many of the old European galleries and Henry Moore wing only minor upgrades to tie them into the overall scheme. However there are many spaces where Gehry had room to play. The new gallery spaces like the glass façade Galleria Italia and south wing galleries demonstrate this freedom. Gehry also designed a series of seating for the gallery, producing chaise lounges he named ‘Adam’ and ‘Eve’.\n    \nDespite the seemingly disconnected nature of Gehry’s additions, the gallery is now fully unified with a harmonious flow. Overall, the new transformation added 97,000 square feet of space, increasing the available gallery space by 50%. As such, the gallery remains one of North America’s largest museums, now boasting a total of 583,000 square feet of space.\n\nSouth Wing\nWhile the Galleria Italia may be the most iconic section of the new addition, the south wing is its most expansive. The wing features four stories that overlook Grange Park to the south. The main level features a glass enclosed sculpture atrium which is link between Walker Court and the Grange building’s member’s lounge. Above the atrium is the first of three levels that are clad in the blue-tinted titanium and glass curtain. The large glass windows on each level have again been humanized with a series of horizontal wooden louvers. On the top floor, large skylights funnel light into the galleries. These upper floors are connected by a 1.5m spiral staircase that features windows on all sides. Inside the galleries, Gehry conceived of a space arrangement that features many small intimate galleries within the larger space. \n    \nGalleria Italia\nThe new Galleria Italia  is located on the second floor at the north end of the AGO. The gallery was named after the 26 Toronto families of Italian descent who each contributed 500,000 CAD to the AGO building project. This gallery stretches the entire length of the AGO with its long glass façade anchored to a ribbed wooden structure. The façade measures 137m and overhangs the sidewalk below. The glass curves toward the building at the top, resembling an overturned canoe. the angle of the glass reflects the old Victorian row houses across the street from the gallery, juxtaposing the old and new. At each end of the glass span, sections appear to be peeling away from the structure, like sails caught in the wind. \n    \nInside the glass façade, a sculpture gallery is bathed in natural light. stretching the entire gallery are massive wooden beams made from Douglas Fir that resemble a ribcage. This extensive use of wood gives the gallery a natural warmth that humanizes the space. The glass wall also allows visitors to peer out into the street, highlighting the muted flurry of activity below.\n\nWalker Court\nThanks to the relocated entrance, the Walker Court, the historic heart of the AGO, now lies at the centre of the building. Gehry has restored the court to its original splendor, adding a glass ceiling that floods the space with light. The court looks out toward the street level entrance to the north and the original Grange building to the south, which now serves as the member’s lounge. Wooden walkways surround the court and let visitors peer down as the walk between galleries one floor above.\n    \nAt the far end of the court, Gehry has added a spiraling staircase that is enclosed on all sides. The Douglas Fir clad stairs spiral straight out of walker court, breaking through the glass ceiling. Once outside they morph into the metal staircase that is connected to the contemporary galleries in the south wing.\n\nABOUT FRANK GEHRY:\n\n“The Art Gallery of Ontario is where I first experienced art as a child and it was Grange Park where I played, so this project means a great deal to me. The building we envision will connect the city and its people to great art and art experiences.” Frank Gehry, Architect\n\nBorn and raised in Toronto, Canada, Frank Gehry moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1947. Gehry received his Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954, and he studied City Planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.\n\nIn subsequent years, Gehry has built an architectural career that has spanned four decades and produced public and private buildings in America, Europe and Asia. In an article published in the New York Times in November 1989, noted architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote that Gehry's “buildings are powerful essays in primal geometric form and ... materials, and from an aesthetic standpoint they are among the most profound and brilliant works of architecture of our time.”\n\nHis work has earned Gehry several of the most significant awards in the architectural field. In 1977, Gehry was named recipient of the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize in Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1989, he was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize – perhaps the premiere accolade of the field – honoring “significant contributions to humanity and the built environment through the art of architecture.” In 1992, he received the Wolf Prize in Art (Architecture) from the Wolf Foundation. In the same year, he was named the recipient of the Praemium Imperiale Award by the Japan Art Association to “honor outstanding contributions to the development, popularization and progress of the arts.”\n\nIn 1994, Gehry became the first recipient of the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Award for lifetime contribution to the arts. In 1998, he received the National Medal of Arts, and he became the first recipient of the Friedrich Kiesler Prize. In 1999, Gehry received the Lotos Medal of Merit from the Lotos Club, and he received the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects. In 2000, he received the Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from Americans for the Arts.\n\nIn 2002, Gehry received the Gold Medal for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Gehry was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1987, a trustee of the American Academy in Rome in 1989, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991. In 1994, he was bestowed with the title of Academician by the National Academy of Design. In 1998, he was named an Honourary Academician by the Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nIn 2003, Gehry was inducted into the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and he was designated as a Companion to the Order of Canada. Gehry has received honorary doctoral degrees from Occidental College, Whittier College, the California College of Arts and Crafts, the Technical University of Nova Scotia, the Rhode Island School of Design, the California Institute of Arts, the Southern California Institute of Architecture, the Otis Art Institute at the Parsons School of Design, the University of Toronto, the University of Southern California, Yale University, Harvard University, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1982, 1985, and 1987-89, Gehry held the Charlotte Davenport Professorship in Architectureat Yale University. In 1984, he held the Eliot Noyes Chair at Harvard University. In 1996-97, he was a visiting scholar at the Federal Institute of Technologyin Zürich, Switzerland. Gehry was elected to the College of Fellows ofthe American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.) in 1974, and his buildings have received over 100 national and regional A.I.A. awards. \n\nGehry's work has been featured in major architectural publications and in national and international trade journals. Gehry's architectural drawings and models have been exhibited in major museums throughout the world.\n\nFor his website, visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foga.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.foga.com\/<\/a>\n\nABOUT THE AGO:\n\nThe Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) is an art museum in Toronto's downtown Grange Park district. With 583,000 square feet of physical space, the AGO is the 10th largest art museum in North America.\n\nThe museum was founded in 1900 by a group of private citizens, who incorporated the institution as the Art Museum of Toronto. The museum was renamed the Art Gallery of Toronto in 1919, and subsequently the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1966.\n\nThe current location of the AGO dates to 1910, when the gallery was willed the estate known as the Grange, a historic Georgian manor built in 1817, upon the death of Goldwin Smith. In 1911, the museum leased lands to the south of the manor to the City of Toronto in perpetuity so as to create Grange Park. In 1920, the museum also allowed the Ontario College of Art to construct a building on the grounds.\n\nThe museum's first formal exhibitions were opened in the Grange in 1913. In 1916, the museum decided to begin construction of a small portion of a planned new gallery building. Designed by Pearson and Darling in the Beaux-Arts style, the first galleries opened in 1918. Expansion throughout the 20th century added various galleries, culminating in 1993, which left the AGO with 413,000 sq ft of interior space.\n\nThe AGO expanded its facility in 2008 with an innovative architectural design by world-renowned architect Frank Gehry. Although Gehry was born in Toronto, and as a child had lived in the same neighborhood as the AGO, the expansion of the gallery represented his first work in Canada. Gehry was commissioned to expand and revitalize the AGO, not to design a new building; as such, one of the challenges he faced was to unite the disparate areas of the building that had become a bit of a &quot;hodgepodge&quot; after six previous expansions dating back to the 1920s.\n\nABOUT THE AGO COLLECTION:\n\nThe AGO holds more than 79,000 works in its collection, which spans from 100 A.D. to the present. Highlights include:\n\nThe Canadian collection vividly documents the development of the nation's art heritage since pre-Confederation, including one of the largest and finest Inuit art collections in the world. The collection includes pivotal works by Cornelius Krieghoff, Lucius O'Brien, James Wilson Morrice, Tom Thomson, the Group of Seven, David Milne, Emily Carr, Paul-Emile Borduas, Joyce Wieland, and Kenojuak Ashevak. Masterpieces of European art include works by renowned artists such as Anthony van Dyck, Thomas Gainsborough, Auguste Rodin, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso and René Magritte.\n\nThe AGO maintains a comprehensive collection of Contemporary art spanning from 1960 to the present, reflecting global developments in artistic practice across all media, including painting, sculpture, works on paper, photography, projection art, and installation art. The collection is defined by strong holdings of leading Canadian artists such as David Altmejd, Brian Jungen, Francoise Sullivan, Jeff Wall, Shirley Wiitasalo, and inflected by major works by international artists such as Mona Hatoum, Gerhard Richter, Doris Salcedo, Tino Sehgal, Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra, Kara Walker, and Andy Warhol. Artists represented in career-spanning depth include Iain Baxter&amp; \/ N.E. Thing Co, Jack Bush, Betty Goodwin, General Idea, Robert Motherwell, Kazuo Nakamura, Greg Curnoe, and Michael Snow. \n\nThe AGO houses the world's largest public collection of works by internationally renowned British sculptor Henry Moore. \n\nA collection of more than 40,000 photographs represents the emergence of the medium in all its artistic, cultural and social diversity. Works by 19th-century British, French, American and Canadian photographers, and 20th-century modernists, including a significant group of 1850s prints by British photographer Linnaeus Tripe, one of the foremost collections of works by Czech photographer Josef Sudek, and more than 18,000 press photographs from the Klinsky Press Agency taken in the 1930s and 40s. \n\nThe Thomson Collection at the AGO includes a broad range of works, from European to Canadian art, ship models and decorative arts. Its European collection includes 900 works from the 12th to the 19th century, featuring Peter Paul Rubens' 17th-century masterpiece, The Massacre of the Innocents. The Canadian collection includes signature works by Cornelius Krieghoff, Paul Kane, Lawren Harris, and Paul-Emile Borduas. The Thomson collection of ship models features pieces from the Napoleonic era to the 19th century, and a decorative arts collection includes more than 500 objects of international significance, including the 12th-century Malmesbury Chasse.","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_m.jpg","width":180,"height":240,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_t.jpg","width":75,"height":100,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_b.jpg","width":768,"height":1024,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_z.jpg","width":480,"height":640,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_n.jpg","width":320,"height":427,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/6\/5091\/5457119847_dd6066ea77_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":3000,"oHeight":4000,"isPublic":true,"id":"5457119847"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"benbobjr","username":"benbobjr","realname":"Ben Abel","ownerNsid":"52559257@N02","faveCount":34,"commentCount":4,"title":"27042","description":"The Grade I Listed Baddesley Clinton, a moated manor house, located just north of the Warwick in Warwickshire. The house was probably established during the 13th century when large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared and eventually converted to farmland. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is run by the National Trust. \n\nIn 1438, John Brome, Under-Treasurer of England, bought the manor, which passed to his son, Nicholas. Nicholas was responsible for the extensive rebuilding of the nearby parish church dedicated to Saint Michael, done as penance for killing the parish priest, a murder reputed to have taken place in the great house itself. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who married Sir Edward Ferrers (High Sheriff of Warwickshire) in 1500. The house remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until 1940 when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited it in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust, who now manage it.\n\nHenry Ferrers &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (1549–1633) made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of stained glass representing the family's coat of arms.

In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick, and the east range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building.\n\nThe house was inhabited in the 1860s by the novelists Georgiana Chatterton and her second husband Edward Heneage Dering, both of whom converted to Catholicism. The house's Catholic chapel was rebuilt, along with a general refurbishment of the house. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The house as it now exists has extensive formal gardens and ponds, with many of the farm buildings dating back to the 18th century. St. Michael's church, which shares much history with the house is just a few hundred yards up a lane.

A combination of incessant rainfall with no respect for the season, home decorating, family commitments, long hours at work (I manage a team doing twelve hour shifts and it's surprising how often twelve can become sixteen), and my own general dislike for summer imagery had left me precious little time to get out and take any photographs.  In fact, it's fair to say I was feeling slightly disconnected - not good for any photographer - although I was pleased to note it didn't take long before my camera began to feel reassuringly familiar in my grasp, apparently forgiving me for it's period of impromptu hibernation.\n\nMy phone rang in response.  Answering it, Keith's query of &quot;You're out shooting then mate?&quot; was met with a spluttering cough before I could reply properly.  Oh, didn't I mention above the cold I'm recovering from?  No?  Oh well, never mind...  Keith's revelation that there was some excellent racing cloud (LE practitioners will understand) where he currently was in Exeter - some twenty miles from me - didn't do a great deal to inspire, although several minutes into our conversation and I suddenly cut him off with the news that the singularly ominous, dramatic bank of cloud I'd been waiting to head nearer was gaining position...\n\n'That cloud is full of rain.  I'm now wet.'\n\nThat was exactly how my next text message read.  Determined to embrace the stalwart British tradition of perseverance, I ignored my sodden shirt and the rain dripping from my nose (at least I think it was rain - damn that cold), keen on removing the lens cap now that the shower had moved on.  Quickly assembling my ND filter lens housing, eager to capture something of the remaining brooding sky without the threat of droplets ruining the shot, I turned briefly to see an enormous dog bounding towards me.  I mean enormous.  Had I meant big, or slightly larger than average I would have said so.  This dog was clearly related to The Hound Of The Baskervilles, and looking beyond it I could see it had two similarly apportioned siblings - both of which seemed unsure whether to rush me or bide their ground in case the first one failed to take me out alone, a feat that seemed highly likely at that point.  I barely had time to register it's unseen owner's shout of beckoning as the animal skidded to a halt, it's intended leap limited to just two dirty pawprints on my jeans.  I didn't care - I was alive!  It's not that I don't like dogs - far from it in fact, I had my own for a good ten years and intend to get another eventually.  It's just that in my experience, most dog owner's I encounter when I'm out taking shot's seem to assume that everyone else loves their pet too.  The number of times I've had to loft my backpack high to stop some beast urinating on it, or shout at one myself as an insidious hind leg begins to cock itself against my tripod - while simultaneously the owner remains conveniently oblivious.  Perhaps next time I'll run after the person concerned, jumping up at them and popping a flash unit in their face manically!  At least on this occasion the owner did make some half-mumbled words of apology as he trudged by with his trotting trio of Satan, Lucifer and Beelzebub...  Looking down I realised I'd been stood all the time just inches away from a pile of what I shall politely describe as canine excrement, judging by the size of which I (perhaps unfairly) attributed to my new four-legged friend.\n\nDeciding it was time to try a different subject from the telegraph poles it had been my intent to capture (I haven't yet reviewed the images but feel I will be lucky if I nailed the shot), I went on to a second nearby site where I've tried several times to shoot a particular item.  Minutes after I got out of the car it started to rain again, leading me to take shelter beneath some overhanging trees at the side of a path, crouching down to gain better cover and trying not to let my resolve weaken.  A second dog walker passed me by, eyeing me suspiciously in my lair as I raised a hand in the universal symbol of 'I'm ok, really I am.'  Several email checks later, a quick game of Angry Birds and a catch up on my flickr contact's recent uploads and the rain suddenly cleared.  Hurrying on to my destination, I was confronted by the newly revealed sun placed directly behind my subject - creating huge contrasts and glare.  I did actually set up my gear, frame everything up, focus and get my filters and cable release ready hoping for a fresh bout of obscuring cloud but it wasn't to be.  That didn't happen until half an hour or so later when I was back in my car heading for home...\n\nNobody said landscape photography was easy!  It isn't, but all of you I'm sure have had occasions like these - and I'm sure you'll agree the good times are all the more sweet because of them.  Yin and yang in all things.  \n\nConsequently, this shot is one from my archives taken almost a year ago on a day when things went my way a little more easily...\n\nOn a separate note, I'm happy to announce my 'Snake' image (elsewhere on my photostream) was a Nominee in the Fine Art category of the recent international Black &amp; White Spider Awards - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thespiderawards.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.thespiderawards.com\/<\/a>.

Exactly a year later, Factum Arte was approached by Walker and Erni through an introduction by Michael Hoppen (founder &amp; director of the Michael Hoppen Gallery, London), to produce a series of 27 vast digital prints of images taken by the photographer.\n\nTim Walker, best known for working for many years as a commercial photographer for British, American and Italian Vogue, has exhibited his works at solo exhibitions for a number of years, in spaces such as Somerset House (2012), the Design Museum (2008) and the Bowes museum (2013). He also received numerous awards during the length of his career, including the Infinity Award for the International Center for Photography, and an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society.\n\nWalker´s obsession with 15th century Netherlandish Master, Hieronymus Bosch, led him to create his own take on his famous paiting the Garden of Earthly Delights. Together with set designer, Shona Heath, the photographer recreated the key elements from a Boschian world. The shoot, which took place over five days at Eglingham Hall in Northumberland, produced a series of sensational, symbolic and highly sensory photographs, filled with exquisitely sensual characters and objects, and deeply striking mise-en-scène.\n\nThe prints, which can now be found at Nicola Erni´s private collection in Zug, Switzerland, were materialised by Factum Arte, and are a result of several material and technological innovations which have been taking place within the Factum Arte studios over several years.\n\nTim Walker´s work will be on view at the Noordbrabants Museum in the Netherlands as part of the exhibition: Tim Walker: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Bosch through the eyes of a fashion photographer (November 4 - February 25, 2018)\nSource: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.factum-arte.com\/pag\/808\/Tim-Walker-br-i-The-Garden-of-Earthly-Delights-i-\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.factum-arte.com\/pag\/808\/Tim-Walker-br-i-The-Garden-of...<\/a>","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_m.jpg","width":240,"height":160,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_t.jpg","width":100,"height":67,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":682,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_z.jpg","width":640,"height":426,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_s.jpg","key":"s"},"c":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_c.jpg","width":800,"height":533,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_c.jpg","key":"c"},"h":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_7d04c1d571_h.jpg","width":1600,"height":1065,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_7d04c1d571_h.jpg","key":"h"},"k":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_f11c901a14_k.jpg","width":2048,"height":1363,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_f11c901a14_k.jpg","key":"k"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_n.jpg","width":320,"height":213,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4656\/38830897295_aa84285681_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":3867,"oHeight":2574,"isPublic":true,"id":"38830897295"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"familymwr","username":"familymwr","realname":"U.S. Army","ownerNsid":"36196762@N04","faveCount":29,"title":"Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311","description":"PHOTO CAPTION:   Awarded Honorable Mention Turtle Turtle by WO1 LARRY OLSON - Division 1 Active Duty Military\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.Facebook.com\/FamilyMWR\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.Facebook.com\/FamilyMWR<\/a>\n\n<b>Photographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311<\/b>\n\nBy Tim Hipps\nFMWRC Public Affairs\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…\n\nRetired Col. Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…\n\nStaff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…\n\n…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.\n\nThere were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.\n\n“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”\n\nWinners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.\n\nWalker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. \n\nThe subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.\n\n“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.\n\n“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”\n\nWalker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.\n\nAbout five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.\n\n“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”\n\nWhat does Walker enjoy most about photography?\n\n“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”\n\nPugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”\n\nPugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”\n\nPiedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.\n\n“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”\n\nThe subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.\n\n“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”\n\nSo what’s real?\n\n“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.\n\n“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”\n\nPiedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.\n\n“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”\n\nPiedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. \n\n“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.\n\n“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”\n\nAs is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.\n\n“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”\n\nPiedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” \n\nSeveral other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. \n\nHolly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”\n\nLt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”\n\nStaff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.\n\n\nSIDEBAR:\n\nHere are the results of the top three finishers in each category with photographer’s rank, name, installation and photo title:\n\n2010 Army Digital Photo Contest\nDivision I \n\nAnimals – 1.

Kilkenny, Ireland.","ownerNsid":"78099783@N00","faveCount":34,"commentCount":152,"title":"SALTEE ISLANDS.","description":"The Saltee Islands, consisting of the Great and Little Saltee, St. Georges Channel are situated approximately 5 kilometres off the coast of Kilmore Quay Co.Wexford. The larger island Great Saltee is the most famous bird sanctuary in Ireland and is very popular with both day-trippers and birdwatchers. These Islands are privately owned and are one of the world's major bird sanctuaries.\n\nThe Saltees are a haven for sea birds, nurturing an impressive array of birds, from Gannets and Gulls to Puffins and Manx Shearwaters. They also lie on an important migratory route and a popular stopping-off place for spring and autumn migrants. The Great Saltee also has a breeding population of Grey Seals, one of the very few in eastern Ireland. Up to 120 animals are present in autumn and up to 20 pups are produced annually. \n\nThese Islands are among the ancient islands of Europe, based on Pre-Cambrian bedrock i.e. between 600 and 2000 million years old. There is archaeological evidence that Neolithic man settled there, and traces of religious settlements exist. There is also evidence of buccaneering and smuggling. A flourishing period in the history of the islands was from about 1500 - 1800 when they were a base for pirates, wreckers and smugglers. The gains of the wreckers and smugglers could very well be hidden in the many caves which have mysterious and romantic names - Lady Walker's Cave, Happy Hole, Otter's Cave and Hell Hole, enough for any Treasure Island. These and other caves can be clearly seen on The Great Saltee Map (Information Page).\n\nThe waters around the islands can be treacherous, hence the area is know as the &quot;Graveyard of a Thousand Ships&quot; and the islands their tombstones.\n\nOne of the most spectacular sights on the Saltees in mid-Summer are the sea birds colonies on the cliffs to the north-east of the Gannet headland. Vast numbers of Guillemots and Razorbills pack the ledges and create a frightful incessant din which only at night abates a little. The Fulmars too play their part in this splendour. Towards dusk the sight of the Puffins congregating in small groups near their nestling sites presents a marvellous sight. \n\nIf the Saltees had any other name before their present title, it has been long lost. As for the origin of the name there are two possible theories, Norse or of Old or Middle English derivation. However the name suggests a Norse origin (Salt ey - salt island) derived from the phenomenon of the salty spray which sweeps across the islands at times of high winds and waves, especially during the winter. \n\nSince December 1943 the Saltees are privately owned by the Neale family. Prince Michael the First died in January 1998 and is buried in the family vault in Bannow Bay, Co.Wexford. He has been succeeded by his eldest son Michael the Second. \n\nPermission for day visits to the Great Saltee, by courtesy of the Neale family, is not needed. Permission to visit the Little Saltee can not be granted due to the hazardous landing conditions.  However we would like all visitors to respect these islands and in the words of the late Prince Michael the First.\n\n \n\n \n\n&quot;All people, young and old, are welcome to come, see and enjoy the Islands, and\n leave them as they found them for the unborn generations to come, see and enjoy.&quot;\n\n                                                                                                           Michael the First\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThese sentiments expressed and carved in stone welcomes all visitors to these islands, erected above the landing steps on the Great Saltee.","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_m.jpg","width":240,"height":160,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_t.jpg","width":100,"height":67,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":682,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_z.jpg","width":640,"height":426,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_n.jpg","width":320,"height":213,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/4\/3033\/5726410532_a7c03f4773_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":1026,"oHeight":683,"isPublic":true,"id":"5726410532"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"linusvanpelt1776","username":"linusvanpelt1776","realname":"VanPelt.","ownerNsid":"82605304@N00","faveCount":5,"commentCount":4,"title":"Ghostly walkers #2","description":"&quot;If I walk down this hallway, tonight \/ It's too quiet \/ So I pad through the dark \/ and call you on the phone \/ Push your old numbers \/ and let your house ring \/ 'til I wake you ghost...&quot;\n\n(Kristin Hersh &amp; Michael Stipe - &quot;Your ghost&quot;)","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_m.jpg","width":240,"height":238,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_t.jpg","width":100,"height":99,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":1017,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_b.jpg","key":"b"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_s.jpg","key":"s"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_n.jpg","width":320,"height":318,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/125\/338414978_8f8fb37724_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":1999,"oHeight":1986,"isPublic":true,"id":"338414978"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"rw-v","username":"rw-v","realname":"RenÃ© Vetter","ownerNsid":"58306981@N03","faveCount":320,"commentCount":15,"title":"To love is to educate","description":"Tim Walker \nThe Garden of Earthly Delights\n\nIn January 2015, Nicola Erni commissioned British fashion photographer Tim Walker to create a series of photographs of his own choice.

It is 19 miles (31 km) north of Manchester. The name means 'valley of the hazels'. In the early 20th century Haslingden had the status of a municipal borough, but following local government reorganisation in 1974 it became part of the Borough of Rossendale. At the time of the 2001 census the town had a population of 16,849.\nHaslingden is the birthplace of the composer Alan Rawsthorne (1905–1971) and the Manchester City and England footballer Colin Bell (b.1946), was the home for many years of the Irish Republican leader, Michael Davitt (1846–1906), and Haslingden Cricket Club is a member of the noteworthy Lancashire League.\n\nPart of what is now Haslingden, along with that of the neighbouring towns of Rawtenstall and beyond that Bacup were part of the Forest of Blackburnshire, that part being the Forest of Rossendale. The Forest was a hunting park during the late 13th and 14th centuries; 'Forest' referred to it being parkland rather than being heavily wooded, as the forest declined much earlier, during the Neolithic period.\nHaslingden grew from a market town (a market was established in 1676) and later a coaching station to a significant industrial borough during the period of the Industrial Revolution. In particular with the mechanisation of the wool and cotton spinning and weaving industries from the 18th to the 19th centuries, and with the development of watermills, and later steam power.\nHaslingden was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1891. In the 20th century the population declined from 19,000 in the 1911 census to 15,000 in the 1971 census. The 2001 census recorded a population of 16,849 living in the town.\n\nHaslingden is notable for its stone quarrying, and Haslingden Flag (a quartz-based sandstone) was exported throughout the country in the 19th century with the opening up of the rail network. It was used in the paving of London, including Trafalgar Square.\nFlagstone is a type of sedimentary rock, relatively easy to split or quarry in slabs, and hence ideal for paving. Locally it is also used for making fences and roofing. There are Upper and Lower Haslingden Flagstones and the name is given to layers of the stone that appear throughout the area (not only in Haslingden) although the most spectacular examples are in the Rossendale valley.\nIn more recent times, Camfil Farr have become the biggest employer in the town. From humble beginnings in 1971 as Automet filtration the air filtration manufacturer has grown organically and by acquisition by Camfil Farr group in 1997. Today Camfil Farr occupy a large site on Knowsley Road and employ in excess of 200 people.\n\n\nLandmarks\n\n\nChurches\n\nHaslingden's Anglican parish church, St. James', was built in the 18th century on a site occupied by a church building since at least 1284. In that year a deed of gift of the Earl of Lincoln to the monks of Stanlaw granted them the parish of Whalley. The church is considered to be the highest parish church above sea level in England.[citation needed] When they later took possession and had a valuation of its assets done, they recorded at Haslingden one of the parish's seven independent chapelries. Beside the Memorial Gardens, the Manchester Road Methodist Church is a classic building with an Italian-inspired interior.\n\n\nThe Public Hall\n\nThe Public Hall was opened in 1868 and built by a private company formed by 'gentlemen representing the working classes and temperance movement'. It was bought by the town council in 1898 but is now largely unused. Used for 50 or more years by Rossendale Amateur Operatic Society, and other local groups, the hall was closed by Rossendale Council in 2005 after an audit commission found them to be the worst council in the country and this was shown in the published league tables of the time.[citation needed] The hall has since been sold by the council to a group representing the Asian heritage community and is in the process of being turned into a mosque (2009\/ 2010). The public hall was once a venue of Winston Churchill during his early political career. Emmeline Pankhurst once addressed the people of Haslingden from the stage and, after the Battle of the Somme in 1916, it was a temporary hospital for the survivors of the Accrington Pals who were sent home for treatment.\n\nSchools\n\nThe Wesleyan School formerly on the site of the current health centre was the first site in the world to introduce standardised intelligence tests for five to six year olds.[1] Haslingden High School is a specialist arts,maths and computing college. Haslingden Primary School was last inspected by Ofsted on 4 November 2010 and received a grading of 'Good' with 'Outstanding' features.\n\nThe library\n\nOriginally Haslingden Mechanics' Institute and opened in 1860, it became the public library in 1905. A blue plaque commemorates Michael Davitt. The young Davitt migrated to Haslingden with his family to escape the effects of the 1840s Irish Potato Famine. He began working in a cotton mill but at the age of 11 his right arm was entangled in a cogwheel and mangled so bad it had to be amputated. When he recovered from his operation a local benefactor, John Dean, helped to give him an education. He also started night classes at the Mechanics' Institute and used its library. Michael Davitt's family home from 1867-1870 on Wilkinson Street is now marked by a memorial plaque.\n\nRailway\n\nHaslingden was once connected to Accrington and Bury by railway (Rush, 1983). The East Lancashire Railway built a station here, which remained open under British Railways until the 1960s, when the line was closed due to the Beeching Report (Wells and Bentley, 2000). Much of the trackbed of the railway is no longer visible, with the A56 by-pass built over it between Grane Road and Blackburn Road, however, the line can still be traced through Helmshore towards Stubbins where several magnificent viaducts still remain. The East Lancashire Railway Preservation Society was originally established at Helmshore Station in the mid 1960s with the aim of reopening the railway line to Stubbins, the project was abandoned with the organisation relocating to Bury in the 1970s and eventually reopening the Rawtenstall to Bury line.\n\nOther notable places\n\nThe town centre is home to the famous Big Lamp originally erected in 1841 and from where all distances in Haslingden are measured, although the original lamp has been replaced by a replica, the original being lost after being taken to America. Cissy Green's Bakery can be found on Deardengate. People visit from across Lancashire to sample the handmade pies which are still made to the original 1920s recipe. Allpine Beds Centre, the largest bed retailer in lancashire, stockists of Burgess beds, the oldest bed makers in Britain are found on Warner Street. To the north of the town is the Holland's Pies factory, and Winfield's, a large warehouse-style retail development selling footwear and clothing, and promoting itself as a family day out. Haslingden's War Memorial is unusual in that it has no names recorded on it. To the northeast there is a 2 kW digital television transmitter serving a wide area.\n\nBeauty spots\n\nThere is an extensive area of moorland to the east of Haslingden. These moors are divided into Oswaldtwistle Moor and Haslingden Moor. The area forms part of the West Pennine Moors. Plans were made in 2007 to build a wind farm consisting of twelve wind turbines on the moors. This attracted both support and opposition, but the plan was approved by councillors in 2010.[3] Further developments have yet to take place, and the plan remains controversial.\nThe nearby Snighole (eel-hole) in Helmshore is a well-known beauty spot. The Grane Valley including three reservoirs to the west of the town is popular with walkers.\nVictoria Park has a bowling green, children's playground, skateboard park and ball court. The top of the park affords views of Musbury Hill.\n\nThe Halo\n\nThe Halo is a Panopticon artwork which opened in 2007 and is sited in the hills above Haslingen as the centrepiece of a reclaimed landscape. It glows at night and is an unusual landmark, with an impressive viewpoint.\n\nNotable residents\n\n•Sir Rhodes Boyson, former Conservative Minister in Mrs Thatcher's government, former Councillor on Haslingden Borough Council, and former Head Teacher of Lea Bank County Secondary Modern School, Rawtenstall.\n•John Cockerill, industrialist\n•Michael Davitt - in 2006 a revamped memorial to Davitt was unveiled by the Irish President Mary McAleese in Wilkinson Street as part of the Davitt centenary celebrations.\n•Beryl Ingham, wife and manager of George Formby\n•The Indian cricketer Vinoo Mankad played for the town's Lancashire League cricket team.\n•Dave Pearson, painter.\n•Alan Rawsthorne\n•West Indies and Lancashire C.C.C. cricketer Clive Lloyd also played for Haslingden in the early days of his career.\n•Robert Scott (VC)\n•Choppy Warburton (1845–1897) born in Coal Hey, just off Lower Deardengate, was a record-breaking runner and a cycling coach. There are frequent claims that he drugged riders to make them ride faster.\n\nBritain's Youngest Politician\n\nIn the 2007 local council elections Sadaqut Amin became the youngest person in British political history to stand as a local councillor. At the age of 18 he stood to represent the Liberal Democrats in Haslingden\n","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_m.jpg","width":240,"height":180,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_t.jpg","width":100,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":768,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_z.jpg","width":640,"height":480,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_s.jpg","key":"s"},"c":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_c.jpg","width":800,"height":600,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_c.jpg","key":"c"},"f":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_d5bb3105c3_f.jpg","width":4096,"height":3072,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_d5bb3105c3_f.jpg","key":"f"},"h":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_e63487db5b_h.jpg","width":1600,"height":1200,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_e63487db5b_h.jpg","key":"h"},"k":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_7cf09ffae3_k.jpg","width":2048,"height":1536,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_7cf09ffae3_k.jpg","key":"k"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_n.jpg","width":320,"height":240,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/9\/8519\/8451022829_2fc3e2b1e8_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":4288,"oHeight":3216,"isPublic":true,"id":"8451022829"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"notkalvin","username":"notkalvin","realname":"Mike Kline","ownerNsid":"61176154@N00","faveCount":51,"commentCount":23,"title":"Walker","description":"This performer's schtick was &quot;standing still&quot;.

Exactly a year later, Factum Arte was approached by Walker and Erni through an introduction by Michael Hoppen (founder &amp; director of the Michael Hoppen Gallery, London), to produce a series of 27 vast digital prints of images taken by the photographer.\n\nWalker´s obsession with 15th century Netherlandish Master, Hieronymus Bosch, led him to create his own take on his famous paiting the Garden of Earthly Delights. Together with set designer, Shona Heath, the photographer recreated the key elements from a Boschian world. The shoot, which took place over five days at Eglingham Hall in Northumberland, produced a series of sensational, symbolic and highly sensory photographs, filled with exquisitely sensual characters and objects, and deeply striking mise-en-scène.\n\nThe prints, which can now be found at Nicola Erni´s private collection in Zug, Switzerland, were materialised by Factum Arte, and are a result of several material and technological innovations which have been taking place within the Factum Arte studios over several years.\n\nTim Walker´s work will be on view at the Noordbrabants Museum in the Netherlands as part of the exhibition: Tim Walker: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Bosch through the eyes of a fashion photographer (November 4 - February 25, 2018)\nSource: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.factum-arte.com\/pag\/808\/Tim-Walker-br-i-The-Garden-of-Earthly-Delights-i-\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.factum-arte.com\/pag\/808\/Tim-Walker-br-i-The-Garden-of...<\/a>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.woth.co\/wothson\/the-garden-of-earthly-delights\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.woth.co\/wothson\/the-garden-of-earthly-delights\/<\/a>","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_m.jpg","width":240,"height":160,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_t.jpg","width":100,"height":67,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":682,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_z.jpg","width":640,"height":426,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_s.jpg","key":"s"},"c":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_c.jpg","width":800,"height":533,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_c.jpg","key":"c"},"f":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_979ff00174_f.jpg","width":4096,"height":2726,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_979ff00174_f.jpg","key":"f"},"h":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_f777f6ac95_h.jpg","width":1600,"height":1065,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_f777f6ac95_h.jpg","key":"h"},"k":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_6e164f7bba_k.jpg","width":2048,"height":1363,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_6e164f7bba_k.jpg","key":"k"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_n.jpg","width":320,"height":213,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/5\/4764\/24859317757_16412d5212_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":4190,"oHeight":2789,"isPublic":true,"id":"24859317757"},{"_flickrModelRegistry":"photo-lite-models","pathAlias":"celticsong22","username":"celticsong22","realname":"Chris C. Crowley","ownerNsid":"7294287@N04","faveCount":4,"commentCount":6,"title":"Selma watches Mishka make a friend","description":"This is one of the few shots I have of Selma (Sheila) before her transformation. Here, she is at the beach with my family, watching my grandmother's dog, Mishka, or Mickey for short, a Wirehair Terrier make friends with a poodle during an outing. This is probably Long Island, and I believe it was about a year before my family built a home in East Patchogue, which back then was simply part of Bellport, and moved from Woodside, Queens. \n\nSelma's life is a mystery to me. All I know is that she and my mother were childhood friends. I think her father owned a candy\/ ice cream shop. I don't even know if she had siblings. She was Jewish and very insecure about her weight and appearance, but other than that, I don't have much to go on.\n\nSometime in 1957, after visiting Mom and me when I was a little tot, Selma, who had changed her name to Sheila, killed herself with a drug overdose because her husband didn't want to be married anymore. It was a shock to my mother, who got the suicide letter written to her as a dear friend, when Selma's mother mailed it after the police did an inquest. Mom saved the letter for the rest of her life. After she died, I found it when going through her things. \n\nI can't even describe how holding that letter in my hands made me feel. Knowing that right after it was written, this poor woman took her own life was overwhelmingly powerful. I could almost feel her pain and despondency as I read her last words. It was as if a spirit of pain and hopelessness was attached to that piece of paper. I took it to the kitchen sink and burned it. I know that sometimes objects seem to be linked to a person somehow, and knowing that my own mother had suffered chronic depression for years, and had mentioned not wanting to live on more than one occasion, (all the time) and that even I had had overwhelming bouts of depression when I was young, I thought getting rid of that object was the best thing to do. I still believe it was. There was a heaviness to it, and that is gone. \n\nI can identify with Selma\/ Sheila. Having been overweight much of my life, and feeling like I didn't fit in, I understand depression. I also understand wishing I could make myself be someone I'm not sometimes, although I don't dislike as much about myself as this poor woman seemed to. We live in a world where people expect perfection, even if they know deep down that it's unattainable. Young women (and men like Michael Jackson) go to great lengths to alter themselves. \n\nIf you, or someone you know, are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please get help. There is always someone who will feel pain at your passing; someone who cared, even if you don't realize how much. Each of our lives is important, and you were created for a purpose, even if it doesn't seem important enough to you. It's important to God, and to the rest of the world that depends upon you to fill your place in it. \n\nI was at the brink of suicide many years ago. I know what that feels like, but I also know that if you ride it out, hope comes in the morning, and on the other side of that depression life awaits. Give that life a chance. Get help. Find someone ELSE to help. You may be the one who stops someone else from wasting their life and throwing in the towel!\n\nSheila would never know that many others would read her story. Decades after she died, she IS remembered. I hope that her life can now help someone else.

That bisect doesn’t absolutely administer to the carve of Emilie Brzezinski and Dalya Luttwak, who are assuming calm in the American University Museum’s “Finding a Path.” Although Brzezinski’s chain-sawed tree-trunk pieces are burlier, Luttwak renders roots and seedlings in steel, not absolutely a aerial material.\n\nWinter River: Winter Mirror – nature landscape art | nature landscape art\n\nThe abutting sculptures on affectation in the alfresco carve amplitude are billed as “a conversation.” Brzezinski’s and Luttwak’s site-specific pieces are placed abutting calm but mostly abide separate. Any of the genitalia could be apparent independently, alike the two pieces of “Mother Earth,” which snakes a gold-painted metal backcountry through a hollowed-out trunk.\n\nThe added duets are beneath intimate. “Split Open” comprises two board forms that resemble behindhand of an oversize, split-open nut, one ancillary of which sits on a coil of white animate twigs. Three cut logs are the accumbent aspect of “Cedars and Vines,” allegory vertical tendrils, all red save for one in black, that aisle the accurate wall.\n\nThe brutalist, greenery-free carve garden is both a accomplishments and capital to the compositions. In a sense, both Brzezinski and Luttwak assignment with begin objects, although Brzezinski hacks absolute trees, and Luttwak replicates the forms of absolute vegetation. For this matchup, the third banal is the amplitude itself.\n\nSeveral of Luttwak’s sculptures, all corrective gold, are included in Watergate Gallery’s “Origin.” The appearance pairs them with collage-paintings by Arrigo Musti, an Italian who met Luttwak aback both apparent at the 2011 Venice Biennale. Their art is apparent side-by-side, not check-to-cheek as in Luttwak’s ball with Brzezinski.\n\nMusti applies acrylic by decrepit rather than brushing, and he incorporates lace, cilia and added abstracts into his work. The ablaze colors and apart gestures arise contemporary, but best of the images are modeled on age-old Greek and Roman frescoes and mosaics. From a distance, the layers and textures advance artworks fabricated with adobe and adhesive and damaged by millennia of wear.

He puts the artery into arcadian portraits such as “The Rose That Grew From Concrete” with graffiti-style backdrops, or by absolutely painting on bright-orange cartage signs. Cleverly, De Valle appointed a historic-Anacostia brand for a apprehension of one of the neighborhood’s best eminent above residents, Frederick Douglass.\n\nSeveral of the paintings, and all of Cory Stowers’s spray-painted tags, were fabricated anon on the gallery’s walls. The artisan accepted as HKS 181 draws with pencil on paper, announcement a able of faculty of design. This affection is aggregate by Asad Walker, whose clean-lined “Skull” ability abode to either a accumulated business close or a motorcycle gang.\n\nAlicia “Decoy” Cosnahan combines graphic-novel artlessness with Catholic imagery, and in one account adds the 1980s D.C.-punk adumbration that replaces the stars in the D.C. banderole with X’s.

Richard Pugh shot three photographs of “Point Lobos,” just south of Monterey, Calif., and combined them into one image by working 15 minutes with Photoshop…\n\nStaff Sgt. Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…\n\n…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.\n\nThere were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.\n\n“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”\n\nWinners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature &amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.\n\nWalker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. \n\nThe subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.\n\n“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.\n\n“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”\n\nWalker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.\n\nAbout five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.\n\n“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”\n\nWhat does Walker enjoy most about photography?\n\n“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”\n\nPugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”\n\nPugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”\n\nPiedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.\n\n“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”\n\nThe subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.\n\n“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”\n\nSo what’s real?\n\n“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.\n\n“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”\n\nPiedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.\n\n“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”\n\nPiedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. \n\n“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.\n\n“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”\n\nAs is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.\n\n“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”\n\nPiedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” \n\nSeveral other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. \n\nHolly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”\n\nLt. Col. Mark Bonica of Fort Sam Houston, Texas, took second in Division I still life with “Reflections in Soap,” third in monochrome with “… and We All Fall Down” and received an honorable mention in military life with “Free Gift When You Join Today.”\n\nStaff Sgt. Brandon Quarterman of Fort Bliss, Texas, won the Division I popular vote contest for “Reaching Perfection,” which topped the still life category.\n\n\nSIDEBAR:\n\nHere are the results of the top three finishers in each category with photographer’s rank, name, installation and photo title:\n\n2010 Army Digital Photo Contest\nDivision I \n\nAnimals – 1.

The population as of the 2011 census was 176. It is to the immediate south, and across the River Wharfe, from Grassington, near Threshfield and eight miles north of the market town Skipton. The green of this small village is set among an old Vanbrugh almshouse, a pub and three stone bridges over its beck. Not far to its north-east, Linton Beck runs down to the River Wharfe at the limestone Linton Falls, there bridged for walkers on a path up the Wharfe's north bank to Grassington.   Amidst the group of cottages close by the Falls is a 14th century, packhorse bridge, 'Little Emily's Bridge', a few minutes' walk from the church of Saint Michael and All Saints. Dating from the 12th century, Linton Church (as it is usually called) spreads an apron of churchyard, decorated with buttercups and gravestones, upon a small river plain bounded by a bend to its east of the Wharfe, as it flows from the Falls toward Burnsall, along the Dales Way. Except at high water, the river is crossed near the churchyard by an ancient course of stepping-stones, below an old (now renovated) mill house.","sizes":{"m":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_m.jpg","width":240,"height":135,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_m.jpg","key":"m"},"t":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_t.jpg","width":100,"height":56,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_t.jpg","key":"t"},"b":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_b.jpg","width":1024,"height":576,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_b.jpg","key":"b"},"z":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_z.jpg","width":640,"height":360,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_z.jpg","key":"z"},"q":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_q.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_q.jpg","key":"q"},"s":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_s.jpg","width":75,"height":75,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_s.jpg","key":"s"},"c":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_c.jpg","width":800,"height":450,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_c.jpg","key":"c"},"f":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_bb0ba3d5f5_f.jpg","width":4096,"height":2304,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_bb0ba3d5f5_f.jpg","key":"f"},"h":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_41ca83b97c_h.jpg","width":1600,"height":900,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_41ca83b97c_h.jpg","key":"h"},"k":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_50a8305543_k.jpg","width":2048,"height":1152,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_50a8305543_k.jpg","key":"k"},"n":{"displayUrl":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_n.jpg","width":320,"height":180,"url":"\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/1\/923\/41453439780_aaf8a867e6_n.jpg","key":"n"}},"oWidth":5720,"oHeight":3218,"isPublic":true,"id":"41453439780"}],"fetchedStart":true,"fetchedEnd":false,"totalItems":14894},"totalItems":4000,"apiParams":{"sort":"interestingness-desc","safe_search":1,"text":"Michael S.
